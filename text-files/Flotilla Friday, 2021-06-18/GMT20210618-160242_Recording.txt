00:26:32	vincent arena:	Pete i added you as host of the event for the 4th :D
00:31:50	Peter Kaminski:	thx :)
00:34:19	Phil Kennedy:	There’s a lot of great work going in parallel, convergence would be great
00:34:39	charles blass:	convergence is upon us :-)
00:34:57	Mark Carranza:	yup -- the stuff of collaboration -- communication and coordination
00:39:08	vincent arena:	the events format was inspired by and built on top of the schema.org schema… and facebook’s event schema (which sucks imo)
00:39:57	Bill Anderson:	so i guess FOAF has been retired, right?
00:40:57	Peter Kaminski:	just zombified, i think. i feel like the spirit of FOAF ended up in microformats2 , but maybe i'm misremembering
00:41:46	Peter Kaminski:	XFN, too: http://www.gmpg.org/xfn/
00:43:42	Peter Kaminski:	lol, the official FOAF status is "in stasis": http://www.foaf-project.org/
00:44:27	Bill Anderson:	ok; i will migrate my foaf to … ? something
00:44:36	Peter Kaminski:	murmurations, i think
00:44:52	Peter Kaminski:	[Murmurations Network Fields and Schemas](https://github.com/MurmurationsNetwork/MurmurationsLibrary)
00:46:10	Mark Carranza:	want to ask before I leave: why is murmurations.network part of the conversation?Asking from ignorance, not critique
00:46:36	Mark Carranza:	i.e., what should I pay attention to?
00:47:05	Peter Kaminski:	they're the folks most publicly working on interoperative schema (in JSON Schema) and syndication/aggregation right now
00:47:58	Mark Carranza:	thanks! will follow up, gotta runhave a great weekend, all

00:52:38	Peter Kaminski:	https://schema.org/Offer
00:53:33	Peter Kaminski:	https://schema.org/Demand
00:53:55	Bill Anderson:	“demand” the worst meaning; “request” is better
00:59:18	Peter Kaminski:	Good Relations gr:Offering  Compatibility with schema.org: This class is a superclass to http://schema.org/Offer, since gr:Offering can also represent demand."
