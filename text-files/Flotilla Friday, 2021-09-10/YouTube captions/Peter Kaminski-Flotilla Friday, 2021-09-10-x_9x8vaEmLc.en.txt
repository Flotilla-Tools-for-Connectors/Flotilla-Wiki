this is a flotilla friday for 2021
september 10th
i
i don't really like having the
recordings but i mean i like having the
recordings i guess but i don't like
recording and feeling like there's
somebody kind of hovering you know these
feature watchers uh hovering over our
shoulders
but on the other hand um
uh wendy alford is a big fan of of uh
a big part of her job is uh you know
text analysis and she's like well i
can't have text if i don't have
transcripts i can't and she when she
talks about transcripts she actually
means human corrected 100 correct
transcripts
and i can't have transcripts so i don't
have recordings and so
you know
well here's a my wife's an
anthropologist and ethnographer
introduction so and then in the bc days
when we used to go out to restaurants
for eating
occasionally she would get distracted
because you know her anthropologist
slammed like she'd be listening to the
table
yeah
because
it's what we do
yeah
reminds me of when my wife and i lived
in southern california and uh sometimes
we'd end up in
in hollywood or right around hollywood
having you know
dinner out at a pizza place or something
like that and all the tables around you
were talking about scripts and script
workshops and you know deals and all
that kind of stuff it was weird
yeah yeah
we're being in silicon valley and all
the tables around you are talking about
uh which round they're trying to raise
and you know whether the good vc is
except for the small little
python glen where they're still talking
about scripts but they're different
sorry i'm just moving on i think a very
good week because i actually got some
code to run and
i kind of learned a lot and i actually
like
the way the code looks so
yeah bill's coming off a little bit of a
high actually being successful in
running code
which is a big deal
um i wonder
uh wendy or michael if you folks want to
talk a little bit about um the clown big
project
and how it's going
please
i can take a stab at it
um
yeah so since michael vinson and i were
able to get together last week
we were
[Music]
basically brainstormed besides aligning
our visions and direction and things
like that we were brainstorming so how
can we bring our visions together and so
that's clambake how do we bring it how
do we bring our visions together so
trove right now this is going to be my
summary it's kind of a warehouse of
organizations projects people right and
in an attempt to help connect all of
those things and and reduce friction for
people to find what they need and
projects to find the people
factor is a
storehouse you might say of
links and topics websites
everything you can find on the web
organized how you want it to be
organized so it's easy to find it again
later with the ability to talk about it
discuss it and all that kind of good
stuff
and then my contribution is
a vision of how we can visualize things
better so that we can navigate to those
pieces of information we're looking for
faster easier
and again reducing friction so i tend to
be all about reducing friction to
getting to what we need my view is also
a little more on the personal side like
the individual seeing a need to
improve
our individual
use of technology
so that we can enable individual
um
evolution i guess evolution towards
better thinking more creativity more
innovation so that we can then
contribute collaborate like that the
individual comes first in my mind and
then it's then you come to the point of
collaboration with others and then
hopefully we come to the point of
collaboration to the point of providing
something for society so i'm just coming
at it from the individual side
so creating a ux ui experience that
enables individuals to get to what they
need solutions they need and then
similarly scaling up to
the same thing for organizations same
things for groups same things okay so
how do we bring all this stuff together
that's clean that's clam cake sorry
and that's so we're fumbling our way so
far it's just a conversation
but any input is totally welcome i hope
i did that justice
did great um how's i i wonder about some
relationships how's that related to maps
of mapping and collective intelligence
and collective knowledge
yeah so for me those are two different
questions for me maps and mapping is the
part of my thinking that says how can we
use technology to visualize
our thinking not necessarily data how
can we use technology to help us say i'm
thinking this and that leads to ten more
things and oh that's interesting that's
interesting instead of sending me down a
rabbit hole pre-designed by someone else
yes visual thinking thank you bill
um instead of sending me down a rabbit
hole designed by somebody else to keep
me engaged and sell me something
what's the direction that i want to go
in so it's you know it's the brain it's
um
as we think it's i think some of this
stuff is really a wisdom tree i've been
playing around with um i think a lot of
um napkin is trying to do that i think
there's a lot of factors basically
trying to do that in its own way
um
but following and enabling better
thinking for the individual again as
being my focus so for me i have a
uh wisdom tree came the closest so far
to fit to the visual version of what i
want not necessarily take technical
capabilities but visual
version of what i'm thinking of um and
yeah just just my background in research
and creativity and um
and connection in human connection uh
has been a big piece of what's informed
how this how the technical visual piece
could work um
knowledge networks to me it's just a
natural extension right of
i need to know i'm researching this now
and i want to both store the knowledge
that i know and i want to expand on it
where i can and then i want to
collaborate with other people on the
parts i don't know yet and then
eventually hopefully create something
that benefits everybody and so to me
that's the
scaling scaffolding knowledge network
piece with a personal version and a
public version and maybe some hybrid
versions for groups that want to work
privately together
again i hope
i did that justice and it made sense
yeah doing great so um when did
[Music]
i think there's a bit of um discussion
about it in
in
the clambic channel too oh i gotta go i
guess i gotta
yeah yes that's the one okay all right
oh that's the one yep
and it's limited i mean
i met the um
i met the one of the founders and um
there's just two guys they just did it
for fun
they're in the middle of working on
other stuff
so
you know i'm i'm not sure how much
development it's going to get anytime
soon i was just super excited to see the
visual version of it
so
yeah if i could if i could combine his
visual the visual he's created in wisdom
tree and put it on like
the brain
i would i would be happy i was wondering
about that visual because
it
um i wonder if you've played around with
obsidian and um
their graph visualizer and there's
actually two there's a there's the
regular one and then there's a fancier
one
i have not yet
and you're the third person to record to
recommend that to me this week
so obviously that's my next if if you
want to get together sometime and and
play with obsidian i'd be happy to do
that
yeah that'd be great
um
i also
noticed that the brain has a new version
version 12.
i don't know how old that is or how
familiar other people are with it but i
was just posting in the clambake channel
the
that
the enhancements they recently made to
the brain and version 12
really improved to the ui a lot
and i'm loving all the stuff that i'm
seeing because it just again brings it
closer even closer to what i'm
visualizing in my mind and the features
that i've i've
outlined for the development that i was
planning on doing but now
now i'm kind of collaborating instead
um
so i'm curious to know if if anybody
else has been using the brain or you
know what other there's
jerry and ask him a bunch of questions
uh we should we should uh have you over
uh
to visit um the frigerator's brain call
where jerry
it's people who are interested in
um data
graphic knowledge bases i guess but we
talk a fair bit about the brain and um
there's jerry often comes and then mark
trexler who also has a very very large
brain that he
has uh somewhat commercialized um
uh
they you know they they know they know a
lot about the brand they're they're
power users super powers and that's the
one who did the climate version one yeah
yeah yeah yeah i was looking at that too
yeah um i remember they were talking
about uh version 12 coming out a couple
months ago and they were you know
there's some nice things in it oh so it
is new okay
yeah
and you you can get stuff well actually
um
you can back up your brain
to a reasonable data file but then
the data file they don't really support
or they haven't documented the you know
export formats or anything or there's an
api but it's kind of private it's not
supposed to be public
um
uh we have code though that does parse
both uh the api and the
and the uh exports the the backups
so it's possible to get data out of it
um but it's not friendly
yeah i know vincent that was my primary
question you anticipated it because i
know vincent uh did that once he did a
portion of it yeah yeah
okay
um is the brain generally collaborative
this is just one more question no it's
not multiplayer either
i i think
that's a bummer that's the most sound
making thing that jerry has right now
that you know he's he's very um
the brain is a really good tool for him
but he really wants to play with other
people and so
yeah
that would be that's the biggest barrier
for me
that in the data format isn't very open
yeah bill
i have questions for you know who wants
to hear um
when you talked about
right well you you reacted when i typed
visual thinking but i was typing too
fast what you were really talking was
about visualizing thinking
and i'd like to hear more
sometime or look at more or have maybe a
time to actually talk about
what
you're getting at there
because partially when i used to teach i
used to
well it was graduate students but i used
to
i used to assert
that they all knew
[Music]
the best ways that they learned things
or had some idea what they were
and so this thing about visualizing
thinking i
i
i would like to know what we're
talking about
because it's an actual activity then i
think
you know having some way of wandering
through with a warehouse in the
storehouse
and making sense out of the two of them
you call trova warehouse and factory
storehouse
and i'm like uh okay but
when we're thinking
what are we doing
that you know it could be about i'm
focused on a task but
sometimes i'm just looking at the clouds
and you know
ruminating
do you want to pick that up wendy
yeah sure um
it's a great question i i think
it's interesting for me to have
technical conversations around it so let
me just
kind of back up for a second and say
i understand the nature of most of the
questions i've i've been i've been asked
from people who work with data
are coming from a perspective where
visualizing
using technology to visualize something
usually means visualizing existing data
for me
because i came at this project from
a direction of positive psychology and
that sphere
i came at it from wanting to start from
the place of the visual
and have the database be in the
background because i know the database
needs to be there right
rather than it being uh the visual being
a way to better
understand data that's already there i'm
trying to use a visual interface to help
me create one to help me see what i'm
thinking right
so
yeah so if i'm
it really the storing of the knowledge
is really just baseline right because i
haven't had this tool already if i'd had
this tool already i would have been
putting things into this user interface
the whole time and the storage would be
there as a default but because we i
haven't had it up to this point then i
need something from which i can maybe
upload some some other documents or
excel file csv files other things
because i've been forced to store
information that way so far
but really i want to see it in this
visual interconnected way because i have
so many
so much going on
and have gone down so many different
avenues of thought and started to
realize how you know i i researched into
this area of of positive psychology and
then i researched over here into climate
change and then i researched over here
into helping my community through covet
and some of those pieces connected to
each other but it was impossible to
connect them it would have been lovely
if in the moment i could have gone soup
like and just connected those two things
for me i'm a visual person that's not
everybody i get that but because yeah um
you just wrote positive psychology and
yeah it's i that's my that's my uh
that's that's basically taking the best
of how we think and what we do and and
and
doing it more often making it more
common and doing it more often so i'm
trying to use technology to enable that
right so in my case it's we're creating
these connections then that are really
the essence of creative thinking
and we are often at our best when we can
be creative and that's where solutions
start to come from so i think there's a
bunch of low hanging fruit low hanging
fruit being storing the knowledge
low-hanging fruit being enabling people
to get to solutions that have existed
for a really long time but maybe they're
not aware of it or they don't know about
it
and then it's
then it's enabling people to be more
creative more innovative again it's a
visual version of that i'm not saying
that's the only way to do this but i'm
saying it's a big piece that's missing
right now that technology could fill and
for for those of us who would find a
benefit in a tool like this i think we
would usually benefit when i talked to
vincent about it i we we've come to a
and michael last week too it was there
need to be different views right
sometimes you need to see things in list
form sometimes you want to see a map
view sometimes you want to look at the
database itself and i think those that
would be a valuable interface is to have
almost like toggles at the top where you
could switch between views or different
views being presented at the same time
and again map you know the brain just
kind of went there and the sense that
you have the
you have uh the
the brain view on one side and you have
the page view on the other so i think
again some stuff like that's coming but
circling back around
my approach to it is from the visual
view and not so much from the data view
um if if i may i kind of wanted to pick
up and and to do kind of a parallel um
rant or chat or whatever um
i've been for the for a week or two
maybe a little bit longer i've been
talking about organizing information
especially as it relates to wikis
and
um
and i have i've been making a couple of
assertions and part of it i i have a
fairly strong position which is
i i strengthen a little bit just to to
be able to articulate it i don't think
it's the only way to think or the only
way that i don't know if it's true but i
like to take a strong position and you
know and talk about that so my strong
position is that
um
one one one thing is that the folks here
people like us are all specialists and
we're able to use uh specialized tools
uh like databases or like lists or
like
visualizations um
and most people
aren't
specialists they're kind of human
journalists and they get through life
without using a lot of the power tools
that we kind of take for granted like
like wikis or like databases or like
lists of things or streams of things
um i think that specialization even goes
out to reading and writing to me reading
and writing is a
specialization um we all take it so much
for granted that it seems like well of
course everyone reads and writes but if
you think about it in your life the
people that you talk to
how many of them have written you know
10 pages how i haven't written 10 pages
recently right how many have written how
many have read 100 pages you know in the
past you know week or month or whatever
right
um reading and writing is kind of a
specialization and we we forget that i
think
so in the same way i think that
information organization
um
uh you have a
piece of paper that goes in a file
folder that goes in a set of another
file folders that goes in a drawer that
goes in a particular cabinet or
probably all of us are old enough to
have used physical libraries
um i i'm going to go look in the either
the old physical card catalogs where i'm
going to look in the computer card
catalog i'm going to find a book about
elephants
and then it's going to give me an uh
coded address for a physical location of
a a floor and an aisle and a shelf
and a section of that shelf where i can
go and grab elephants and i can grab
other books close to elephants
um
all of that so
i think
probably each of us grew up in an
environment where that was kind of just
obvious that was kind of just something
that that everybody did
so
when i see people pick up a wiki
i see them kind of recapitulating that
thinking right
of course
of course everybody reads and writes um
of course everybody organizes things by
categories or by hierarchy
um and that's
and i i come up on you know it's it's
fairly common people are going okay well
i'm organizing information and here's my
hierarchy right
we don't start the conversation about
what what information is what knowledge
is how we communicate we just go
straight to this hierarchy right here's
my hierarchy i'm comparing it to
somebody else's hierarchy mine is better
than theirs or there's a better than
mine and where i i want to figure out
how to map hierarchies i'm like
so the the pitch and massive wikiland is
like yeah hierarchies and even
categories and stuff like that aren't as
interesting as connections links between
um
information
um
uh and context um
so when i when i talk to people about
you know uh they the question is how am
i going to organize my information in my
wiki i'm like well
don't worry too much about organizing it
worrying worry about capturing it and
improving the way it has been captured
moving up from kind of a stream of
consciousness set of notes or thoughts
you know improve that slowly over time
and it could be like over weeks or
months or years in a wiki you know where
you start to cluster the information and
you start to connect it to other things
and then look for ways that you connect
information this stream of consciousness
oh this reminds me of other streams of
consciousness i've had in the past and
my wiki let me make a draw a link
between them right
um
uh
the the and then a way that wikis work
especially when you get a number of
people doing a wiki together which is
something that we don't see anymore but
we used to do it all the time 15 years
ago
there's an interesting thing that
happens that people start thinking alike
they think in a group brain way so
i used to see this all the time
somebody would start to organize
something a certain way and then
somebody else would pick up that
organization and improve it a little bit
or make it worse maybe a little bit
they'd have some conversations around
the edges in a chat system or in real
life and they'd say oh i saw that you
started putting headers this way or i
saw that we started making links or i
saw that we started having this
convention of
naming pages a certain way here's my
idea about that or i like that and
here's the thing that i'm going to do
another thing that's similar to that or
different than that and
as we started working together in wikis
we had this collective way of managing
information organizing information and
linking information and
knowing kind of having body language
around
um you know you could you could end up
looking at somebody's page and and kind
of know what they were thinking about
that page oh they kind of left it in a
draft state and i know that i can
improve it or
you know this is a this is a page where
they they obviously have a strong
opinion about it this is a rant and i'm
not going to touch their rant except
maybe to fix some typos what i'll do is
i'll make a link to it
and i'll have a separate rant on a
separate page the kind of body language
of you know what this information space
means and what we're doing with it and
things like that it's something that
kind of
improves and
evolves over time and
one of the things i i
notice about humans is that
when we're doing culture together
it brings people closer together it
builds trust it builds relationships
that we can rely on and then build upon
those relationships to do a better job
of keeping information things like that
one of the
some some people will look at kind of
the chatter or the chit chat or the the
slow process of organizing information
kind of organically rather than
you know having a library sciences
person come in and say okay you've
screwed up your information here's the
way to do it
that's not really what i i want out of
my wikis the wikis i participate in
right except you know sometimes you need
that there are cases when you need that
but in the main what you want
is to have this culture
forming that understands how the
information is put together wants it to
be better and works on that together
and builds
human relationships about how we're
doing that
and people are just slow that way and
it's a good thing it's a really good
thing when we go slow and we honor each
other's
trust and we honor relationships to one
another and when we make jokes about
things or we tell people that we're
upset about things i can't believe you
stomped on my page why did you do that
you know and you can it's okay sometimes
to be mad at somebody
and you work things out right
all of this stuff i'm kind of describing
humans as they have been for thousands
of years right tens of thousands of
years if you think about humans and the
way they communicate and the way that
they do knowledge
it's not written down it's not in file
folders it's not in a library the way
you human the way you culture
is
by
having emotional connections with one
another having trust bonds social trust
bonds with one another
and
the way that you
communicate information is in what i
call stories and when i say story i mean
probably something pretty small
even as small as a single sentence is to
me a story right subject verb object
um uh uh
last time grandma got too close to the
bear cave she got eaten you know or
um or
uh auntie was out collecting berries and
then she found this new kind of berry
which is awesome
or she found this new kind of berry she
ate some and she got sick
um
those are the kinds of things that's i
think so my another strong assertion i
have is that
people
knowledge if i can use knowledge as a
verb with stories
and so all of the
technical specialization tools that we
have
um are are largely not entirely but
largely ways of
of storing and
maybe serializing a story into a form
that you can pull out later so text when
you write down a
a piece of text hopefully what you're
doing is
essentially
your brain is telling a story of how
something happened to you and then you
you actually tell a story about the
story that happened to you you can't
really relate the thing that happened to
you but you related a story about it
what it meant to you
and
we have this trick where we we serialize
language spoken language into text
and then later i can or somebody else
can deserialize that back into speech
and language and stories
and
it's not the text that is the
communicator it's actually the story
that i tried to serialize into text and
the story that somebody deserialized out
of the text so the story there is the
interesting part
um so then something like a map of
visualization is kind of the same thing
where you take um
you take a bunch of stories and you can
put them in a visual space and you can
and and but then the way that you use
the map is
me later looking at my map or somebody
else or me
showing somebody else my map it's like a
is connected to b this way
b is connected as a c and d these ways
and you you tell a story around the map
and that's the the value of the map is
it's a way to remind yourself of the
stories that you can tell in that space
and when you make a map and give it to
somebody else
if you did a good job what happens is
that they can
brainstorm over the map that you've
created
and tell stories
they can't look at a map and get all the
visual relation they don't get the
relationships of all of that stuff
in a flash what happens is they look at
a map and they go okay
if i need to get from the empire state
building
to
uh
to the the met
what i have to do is find this station
and use this line and then go to this
station and make a transfer and then go
to another station and get out right
you tell yourself a story of how to
navigate the map and that story again is
the important part the map is just a way
of giving you hints about what the
stories are right and where the stories
are it helps you remember how many
stories that you can get it helps you
synthesize news stories you know if
somebody made a map of all the subway
stations in new york
maybe that's not super useful to them or
to you but when you can turn it into
something like i need to get from the
empire state building to the mat
then you've synthesized the story out of
it that they didn't write down they
wrote down all the possible stories with
the subway stations but the story again
is the the interesting and important
part
so then
one of the things that i observe with
these visualizations
graph visualizations of of knowledge
bases always look like junk to me
if they're automatically done
and it's i think what happens is that
when you just have the machine say okay
here's all the connections
you didn't capture
the ability to do you didn't capture a
story there wasn't a human that said
you know this is a is connected to b and
b is connected to c and it's important
because you just had a database query
that said okay splat all the possible
connections on the screen right
and then maybe if you're lucky some
gravity forces kind of organized it into
a way that is least objectionable
but
the
the process of just making a
visualization doesn't make meaning and
it doesn't make stories and things like
that it's when somebody comes along and
curates that and says okay
so now i've got a picture of 200 nodes
let me filter out the ones that aren't
meaningful let me highlight the
connections that are meaningful and
here
ms reader is a story that i can tell out
of this mishmash of big data
i've i've curated it into stories
so my whole thing is is stories are the
way people think the the way that people
knowledge we use specialized tools to
help us
story
but we don't want to get distracted by
the fact that the tools that the tools
aren't the story right um the
the stories are still the story and the
tools just help us
serialize stories and deserialize
stories
so that's my pitch
mark i think maybe you're up next except
you're muted
mark you're
muted sorry um yes i am up next uh by
hand uh signal but i'd love to hear
responses to what peter just said
i i asked a question i'm in the chat um
about
stories
um it's funny i was in a conversation
yesterday uh with um
some uh
um cta
[Music]
collaborative technology alliance
folks about um
[Music]
ontologies and
schemas and
um
and
was thinking out of what they were
saying about
um
trying to strip down to
um
people
you know agents those that can be
profiled um those that have agency
um
for lack of a better word
data information
nodes um
[Music]
a second category that is just stuff
without agency but but information that
gathers
um metadata and stories i would say as
well
story elements as uh
as it accumulates i mean things that
stories can be told about
um
and then containers which is a much
looser thing which i wonder if it might
include stories
um that when you
um
take all these
random books in the library
some of which were they not constrained
by physical space might fit in multiple
sections or
might fit in together in different ways
according to different people
but you allow all these overlapping
containers
and stories
to be created around them
which
um
[Music]
you know which
of course their hair brain stories
told about the same set of facts
but there's there's an inherent
vetting and building of reputation in
seeing
the gravity of
the connection between certain facts
data points pieces of information
that different
agents have drawn in a story or by just
tagging them the same way or
by
just connections that they have drawn
um
and i don't know if those three elements
uh
i see bill
just asking the question what is a fact
before is a fact you know a data point
an assertion which may be wrong
which
you know and yes
incorrect
data points can
build some gravity um
around a story that certain people are
saying telling each other but if you
also have
as as metadata around that item other
people saying this is wrong
um and other people with with expertise
in that area saying this is wrong
that can be telling for people if you if
you go to that piece of data
in a random access way
there's a little bit of a story that an
individual piece of data
tells
that
that has
the information that different agents
has the
the containers um
i.e stories tags
um groupings
that
that different agents have put on it to
say wow this this
alleged fact
is
um
is associated with some things that
other people say are wrong and the
people who are expert in this field
seem to say that
this is wrong it's there's at least
controversy here
um
you know the the visualization of this
can be
done in many ways um
sorry i'll i'll stop but i mean i just
wanted to throw out the idea of
um
that that random access quality being
sort of a leveler because anybody can
just come upon
whether digitally or in the world um
an item of information
and if part of our job
and part of our job in creating
interoperability
is to
associate as much
metadata and as many
stories and containers that have been
put there by other people
um
to let somebody find something and let
them
use the
all the spokes all the edges you know
that come out of it to
find people find
related information
dispute it
um
find the stories that are built around
it
um i think that's that's a little bit
our job
um thanks um michael and uh thanks peter
um these are both great um
notions i am fairly known um or at least
unfairly known
fairly unknown for uh basically
um
trying to
take the position that it's not all
stories
it's context it's different types of
elements statements
oppositional
propositions vague propositions
questions
and
i find the story focused to be
in the study of how we
basically grow and understanding to be a
limited kind of view um i just
um
i'll try i'll
i'll i'll just put that out there and
and come back to it later but i
certainly appreciate um
the
slow culture
vision of or
story or example that peter told
um
i posted a
james maxwell quotations
and i'll just post the quotation
in there
basically
and i'll read it out
it's part of a 1978
um
i'm looking for the encyclopedia
britannica where apparently this
[Music]
quote on entropy is but let me read it
out a memorandum book does not provided
it is neatly written
appear confused
to an illiterate person
or to the owner who understands it
thoroughly but to any other person able
to read it
it appears to be inextricably confused
so we've all had the experience of being
in class
and sharing notes with other people and
basically
some people's notes are clear and
understandable to us
other people's notes are impenetrable
and what i love about this quote is it's
in the middle of
available a discussion of entropy
available energy and dissipated energy
is heat and um
this
uh
notion of organization
is linked to
the states of motion um of atoms um but
anyway the this little chunk
um really puts out a
a case to tie back to what peter was
talking about
about some kind of collaborative culture
where we learn each other's signs
and organizational systems
and adapt mutually to each other so that
we can have an artifact that is mutually
meaningful
now
whether that can be done on a website
like factor or
even wikipedia um
people are actually doing that people
are actually developing
different ways of communicating
um
when i was involved with um
uh 3d
um
vermo vrml
um
it was a idea to create 3d spaces on the
web
and like html you could cut and paste
and make your own stuff
but
i went to architecture school and
learned how to think in three dimensions
people can
do the writing
of html
and the reading of html in a browser
very
easily to actually create visual
or at least i'll use the 3d example to
create
spatial 3d spaces that make sense
it was an authoring problem you
you could not author a 3d space
as easily as you could
the 2d web page
and it it kind of fizzled out and
and died so
certainly what i'm trying to point out
are the two aspects of creating these
shared knowledge spaces
the writing part and the reading part
they're not
always
as clear as we might
ourselves imagine when it comes to
involving other people
and um certainly
um i loved what
michael and peter were talking about
and unfortunately i've got to go in
about four minutes but
thanks for listening
thanks mark
um along with the the maxwell code thank
you mark um i wanted to share a kafka
letter
from kafka letter
um it
came up in the context of a smaller part
of the quote of it but it's a fun
[Music]
um it's a fun letter it's in german so
you have to
you have to translate it but um
[Music]
uh the the small quote was
um words or really a book a book must be
the
ice axe for the frozen sea within us
but
the whole letter is lovely
and i won't
i mean
grab it and uh grab it and translate it
that's not the that's the poll quote but
that's not the best part of it
vincent
hello everyone
i have like a
half-baked thought
um
whenever i
find information
or stories that are really interesting
um
my one of my first
kind of urges is to like save it in a
place where i know i can find it later
and
i don't know
if that's
like
almost like a bad learned habit because
life is too demanding and we don't have
the time when we come across something
we like to actually like
sit with it it's like you know you come
across like a
patch of berries but there's like a you
know a wild tiger chasing you and so you
can like look at it take a mental note
of like where it is and then you have to
keep running away
and so i don't know if that's um and
like a realistic
uh
analogy um because maybe we'll never be
in a time where we can actually go
through things but yeah i very rarely
um
there's this one tool i use called
refined when i open a new tab and it
shows me like really interesting
articles and occasionally i'll like open
up one of those articles and and read it
but most of the times i'll save it for
later and then when i do have the time i
will open it up and read it
but yeah like for me there's like almost
two separate processes there's the
process of like
being emergent engaged in stories which
is like the actual juicy stuff like
that's like the berries that's what you
live for but then there's like a whole
other process which is like all right
we're like hunting for
the stories for the berries it's like
and that's that time
is kind of unknown you don't know when
you're gonna come across something and
so i feel like having an information
system which actually can help me
take that unknown and make it a little
bit more known like when i search for
something on google i'm not sure if it's
going to be on the first
result of the page or it's going to be
on the like 107th page or i'm not going
to find it at all
um so having a way to like search and
find information that's like reliable
that when you do want to like sit down
and and engage with a story you know you
could find it um like last night i spent
a half an hour looking on like you know
four different websites for a movie to
watch that was on netflix and that um
wasn't over two hours because we didn't
have that much time uh and that was not
super action-packed because i actually
got into a surfing incident i was like
super adrenaline
adrenaline filled and i wanted something
relaxing uh ended up just watching
planet earth because that was the only
thing that i knew was
i knew was there
uh
that met the criteria but i couldn't
actually find what i was looking for
and um yeah so that's kind of
information management tools and wikis
aren't just about the stories i think
they're also about finding the stories
and that process could be different
um i'll jump in if nobody else is
uh i would
love to come back to that first thing
you said vincent about about running
from the tiger and uh
and you know not having time to deal
with the berries um
i think the stories
that we tell
and the things the information that each
of these agents
gathers in the random way that they do
like i'm running from a tiger there's
some berries mental note
i'm throwing that in the
the food folder
that that association of
food and place
where it like where it's something that
you could look at where somebody else
who was running from a different tiger
you know
in a different direction
you would never go back maybe to that
that
berry tree
um because there are tigers around there
but uh
um
if that information were recorded if
that metadata were recorded
and
layered on the metadata of other people
doing different things some of whom
weren't running from tigers and had time
to stop and taste the berries and say
these berries are really good
and
that were mapped in a way that said hmm
there seemed to be a lot of these berry
trees that a couple people have said
were really good
in this area the north part of it has
lots of tigers in it but the south part
of it you know this is the way that
knowledge emerges and stories emerge
from just one random bit of metadata
that could be the metadata that is you
putting it in a folder for later
you know what i'm saying and and
that
kind of layered
interactive
non-storytelling just container
placing
um
seems seems to me
something
there's something there so please please
keep uh
maybe it's not yielding much yet but
please keep putting those things you see
into a container or tagging them or you
know i think we all should and then we
have to figure out how we can all see it
bye mark
okay i'll jump in so
i'm gonna go back to something i posted
and then bring it back around to stories
and everything everybody's talking about
because i find this super interesting
so i think
what i'm hearing and what everyone's
saying
is
we're talking about
capturing and storing knowledge
in different phases i guess i would call
them phases
where and so what i posted before was
sometimes we want to just get to a
resource right either it's a piece of
information we need right now we don't
really care about it at other times or
just curious or a friend post you know
pointed us to something but it's not
really our thing or we just told we need
to learn something for some reason or
whatever right we just need we just need
information it already exists we need to
get it from a book or a website or
something
to me that's a very different process
than i'm exploring something that i
really love it's a new hobby or i'm more
interested it the more i explore it and
i want to go deeper and i want to go
broader and i want to you know i want to
remember what i thought of three months
ago when i was researching this but then
got sidetracked from researching this
that kind of
knowledge
storing and learning and then we
sometimes want to explore something that
really no one knows yet or there's very
little information about
and then and that's a completely
different thing i completely agree with
the thread of stories i don't know that
we always think about it
but i do think you know all the research
and psychology even points to the fact
that we're always creating a story in
our mind we have a story about how we
feel about things we have a story about
who we are we have a story about what
what our origin is we have a story about
how we see the world that provides the
filters and the perspectives that we
have on the world and whether we're
consciously conscious of it sorry
whether we're conscious of it or not we
are forming those stories all the time
and i i don't know yet whether
technology
would benefit us in pointing out that
process or simply just presenting us the
pathways with which to to to get to
where we need to go but i think both are
valuable and i
i guess what i'm trying to say is
all of these things are important all of
them have value whether we're just
passing something by and we need to put
it you know the there we saw the berries
and we were racing by
and so
we think we need to store it
um for later when we're hungry and we're
not being chased by a
tiger but what if
somebody else had already stored that
knowledge for us and we could trust that
our society had that knowledge stored
for us so we didn't even have to waste
the energy
to store it that we could go find it
when we needed it and we could trust
that we could find it when we needed it
when when it was important and it might
even then be surrounded with the best
time to go is in the spring when the
tigers have moved away and there's no
one around right and you can take your
time gathering in fact and then here's
how to
process the berries so that the last
through the winter so that when the
tigers are there you don't have to write
like
that yes that to me is the ideal right
is it's let's guess past the point where
we're each curating for ourselves there
will always be that piece but what we're
also curating for each other
simply because i already curated it for
myself
why not give it to you as well right
it's common knowledge now so to me
that's the juicy spots right whether we
want to frame it in stories or not
stories to me it's more valuable
to frame it in what kind of
phase i'm in
am i in a phase of i just need some
information and i'm am i in a phase
where i'm really deep diving into
something and i want to use use the
interface or the
community or the interaction or whatever
to really learn something
deeply
am i in a phase of creating something
brand new
if i were to try to break it down into
three
but i think there's it's a continuum
really
any thoughts
off of um what was being said in the
chat here um
what vincent was saying of who do you
curate for
um who are you working for you others
both
um
that
it's really interesting one of the one
of the uh
the use cases the user stories um
that
we imagined for factor in
earl early days where when our
orientation was more
um
un related ngo
um gathering um
[Music]
gathering information
so that
you know people on the ground in one
place were seeing the same things that
you know somebody in new york was seeing
um
and realizing that some of the
data that needed to be gathered
would be gathered by people who didn't
know what its significance was and that
had to be
surfaced
like you know somebody in sierra leone
takes a picture of
somebody's arm and says you know what
the hell is this this
disease that's you know forming on you
know not not being a part of a un team
not
being anything just just wanting to like
say hey
berries on this bush you know
i don't know what it means where it fits
i'm not sure this is for me or for you
or for the greater world but just
you know data point
um
and
so you know that we don't really know
why we're gathering you know not all of
us are information gatherers but we're
kind of all information gatherers and
the easier it is for
everybody
to
share their information
if it's not something they need to keep
private
without knowing what its significance is
without knowing where it fits i mean the
the the the metadata on
the berry photograph or the skin
photograph could just be a date and a
location and that's all there is but
somebody who is researching because
they're doing a deep dive and looking
for examples of
berries in this region
you know can find that um
yeah so um
yeah
um
just to what wendy what you were saying
about um
i don't have to gather this information
because
um
because somebody else has already
gathered
it i find the information that other
people are have already gathered because
i
gather the same piece of information
that i don't know
i don't know where it fits
but i find out where it sits
from from the other people
um
you know picture of it
at at a more mature state
a picture of a berry in this place
brings up
all this information about you know
recipes for how to cook that berry how
to dry it for the winter as you were
saying you know
watch out for the tigers
all kinds of stuff so
yeah um
i think we're
we're getting some good stuff here
shall we go
okay so
i'm having a bit of a hard time with
this conversation because i don't really
know how to think about it
literally
so i
maybe i'll make some notes and send them
out but i i'm a little confused about
this word story which has now become so
big that it has it's losing its meaning
for me
or the meaning i used to have so i'm a
little confused there although i i
actually believe everything you're
saying
i just i'm getting kind of unhinged here
so in a way that
isn't helpful
and uh
so i don't really
i don't i don't know i have this is
so it's quite generative you know this
is a really rich conversation but i
think
for me at least it's going to take a lot
of work to come up with
to make sense of
just what we've talked about
and the idea of looking things up
because oh i've seen this very what is
it
in the neighborhood i live in texas
people just take pictures of snakes in
their garden and post them on facebook
you know and either my wife or the snake
wrangler comes back oh that's just a
that's just a rat snake you love those
things they they
they eat things you don't want around in
your yard
you know so people
don't expect
to find it online
they expect some neighbor to go oh that
thing just
you know don't worry it's not interested
in you
like the rattlesnake which is like you
want to come you want you want a piece
of me come and take it
right
most snakes are like oh there's a big
two-legged i think i'll i think i'll
hide out
so i'm just to say that i think this is
super rich
and i don't know how to make sense of it
i'm not sure i agree with all the
assertions
so
the way to make sense of it is to keep
talking and obviously not necessarily we
can do it asynchronously but then the
other the other trick of that is to
remember what we're talking about
which is going to end up maybe in text
yeah and i
well
yeah
well
i don't know maybe later this week i'll
find out
when i know that i'm actually thinking
rather than doing something else
that would help if i could say oh now
i'm thinking
as opposed to what bill
uh
daydreaming
you know
um it's it's super interesting so thanks
thanks
thanks for it
yeah so as you were talking bill i think
i might have an example that might help
because it's in the um
realm of education
so i always pictured
a
visual interface let's say you're a
teacher and the traditional model and
you can please feel free to correct me
would be
i as the teacher know the body of
knowledge that i need to cover in a
semester i'm going to start here
and i'm going to go through this path to
get here
we're going to take some branches if i
think they're important tangents to help
people understand of course i'll take
questions and stuff but i basically have
my curriculum mapped out i've got my
exercises i've got my group work i've
got my
labs i've got whatever even maybe a
field trip thrown in there to help
integrate the knowledge right
if
i could take what i am visualizing and
give it to a teacher this is how i can
imagine it working
i'm a teacher
i plan a couple days in advance with a
visual representation of the knowledge i
plan to teach in its smallest
beginner form
of just say a node and a couple of
connections
on day one we talk intro we meet each
other all that normal stuff and for
homework the kids assignment are to add
one thing
to the tree collaboratively
add one piece of information the
discussion is why did you add that piece
of information and how does it relate to
the topic that we're talking about in
class
that could happen at a regular basis
over the course of a semester at the end
of every semester
the tree of
curated knowledge around the topic from
which we've been learning looks
different every single time right
because
of what different students will add
and why they added it
the why they added it is the story
i added this piece because i was it made
me think of la right so history but it
made me one student think of how her
family cooks and she ends up adding a
recipe and a little story about how this
particular recipe fits into history and
where it came from either from her
family or or from the food or whatever
whereas another kid goes off into
politics and talks about you know wants
to integrate what's happening now with
what happened then right and and that
becomes the story and that storyline
even if
not only helps us
learn because that's how we think
even when we're not conscious of it we
think in associations we learn much
better when we connect a piece of
information as you probably well know
right to something else we already know
than if it's a piece of information it's
just kind of floating out around there
and doesn't seem to connect to anything
so
it's helping literally build those
connections in ways that are meaningful
to the people in the room
is that i don't know if that helps or
not but it's the way i think of it yeah
that's genius actually um
and when i was teaching at the ut it was
a graduate level course on scientific
data informatics
you know i've shared that big list of uh
mind maps
but that's exactly how the course this
course started with a little scalpel
diagram
of
now i didn't have i wasn't you know when
we were trying to talk about what's this
the you know the information
what is that was the information
properties of scientific data
i just would tell the class i said look
there's no textbook
we are here on our own
and i would say my goal for you is to
have a worthwhile learning experience
you know any hitches
i can't do it for you
you're going to have to do it for you
i'm going to have a great one because i
always do because
i'm interested
in that but
so that's the way i didn't really have
the idea of
if i were doing it now i think i would
have more technology to help people
actually build an annotated kind of
i don't know some monster i would
actually build a wiki
of
the results of
you know these whatever
15 weeks of
interacting
but yes i mean i think that is
you know
yeah well so yes i agree
i did that
yeah so does that clarify
story to you because that was where you
were
yeah that's a nice idea just but i don't
know in this conversation it got super
big like a pumpkin
which is something lucy sletcher and
derek's park used to talk to the tech
people about interoperability she used
to say that's like a big idea it's like
it's like a pumpkin
because
you know
my wife was there too so just to push
back on the tech people they're like
what what are you talking about
yeah and i think again it's it's
multi-layered right i have my individual
story about myself i have the story
about this classroom i have the story
about the teacher the story about what
i'm learning that either provides it
meaning or makes me think it's stupid
and then and to me it's the it's the
scaling up version of that you know
wendy alford's version of that would be
we're
we're we're a top we're trying to look
top down on a very complicated situation
and if we collect stories we can
make sense out of the threads that exist
and see into what other people aren't
seeing within them you know within their
own within their own frame of experience
right so it's still be it sense making a
larger story which until computers came
along really the only way you could do
that was sit around a fire and share and
share stories right and see where the
thread was now she's taught she's able
to
find the thread so instead of a thread
of knowledge weaving through the
semester of a classroom going slightly
in one direction or slightly in the
other direction depending on the
students you now have an entire
community a city an organization or
whatever who are also going in one
direction and if management thinks
they're going in this direction but
they're actually going in this direction
that's worthwhile knowing because
otherwise we're solving the wrong
problems or putting our energy in the
wrong ways
yeah well i just want to add one thing
i'm going to have to jump off in it for
maybe another five minutes but
so the one thing that i came up for me i
didn't type it in the thing is that when
we start using story the way i've been
hearing it that almost things
it sounds to me
now we're gonna reduce almost every
experience they have to like you're
telling a story
so once things get reduced i'm like i'm
done now
because that's an intellectual like
model and sorry i'm a human organism
i'm not sorry sorry not sorry well
whatev but um so i think
if it gets if the word gets to be
everything is a story
then after a while
we we're not
you know what i mean we're going to lose
what it is we're talking about which
actually needs
depending on the task certain
distinctions to be made
bill i actually think you just got to
something which was
i was about to say that
the
if i'm hearing you right
the
the negative association
um
that you have with stories is
kind of their
you want them
well i won't try and characterize what
you're saying i'll just say what i was
going to say which is
that the
people write stories about
berries and tigers and legends and you
know all kinds of mythology could be
built around berries and tigers we're
going to be talking about berries and
tigers for a long time um
but
the disem disambiguated
information there that led them to tell
the story
um
is
is what you want to get past
like
not that stories are bad but sometimes
you don't want to hear somebody else's
story you want to filter out the stories
but just know that stories were
told about this thing that information
was attached to it that you may want to
associate in different ways
so
like i want the benefit of the fact that
this thing
that somebody told a story about
has these attributes
that it's in this place that it's that
this snake is in this yard in this
city
and that somebody else
told a different story that happened to
have another stake in this yard and
before you know it hey i realized that
these snakes are
you know
indigenous to this area
and you know and the fact that
that somebody you know that this this
question and answer that you have on
facebook
which is
um not the result of search
not the result of true storytelling
that we want to preserve that disem
ambiguated information
and let that be a part of other people's
research and other people's knowledge
right now it's siloed
only on facebook perhaps you know
privately only on somebody's or you know
some
friend groups
um
uh you know page
that you know a dozen people have access
to
where they're not they might be private
about the banter but they're not private
about the fact that there's a snake
in a photograph with this you know time
and and location metadata
if it was anonymized
um
yeah i just want to say one more thing
before because you said something super
critical
you use the word
um
you had a
either true storytelling or something
you called some you had an adjective on
storytelling that was different i don't
have a negative
association with the word story i'm just
responding to how it seems to be being
used as we have this conversation
oh yes but something
so if there's something called you know
true storytelling then we better find
out what that is
before we start using the word story for
all these
about many other things
i just think this is a longer more
interesting
conversation and
i really do have to run and
squeeze the dog as i like to say he
actually does the squeezing but you know
so i'm going to leave you all here and
maybe i'll catch up on the video
hey and i can use the little
we can get the chat thing out of the
video can't we
we have tools for that
adios everybody have a good week see you
bill
more thoughts
yes
yeah i really like what you had to say
michael
um i put a couple things in the chat
as you were talking trying to capture a
little bit of what you're saying and
maybe add a little
a little um extra too um
yeah and i kind of agree with bill it's
it's i'm not sure we need to
continue to use the word story all the
time
but it is an interesting exercise to
think about it
and i do think there's a line between
when
we when we
seek out stories
either from each other
in person or whether it's
you know through technical means um
in the traditional sense versus what our
understanding might be of how we work
unconsciously and like when we get into
that i think
um there's a value there to just
understanding that that thread runs
through everything but i think when we
start talking about what features or
what attributes or what characteristics
do we want certain
interactions and connections to have
i think story needs to be kind of put
back in where and to more of the
traditional sense um you know if i'm if
i'm creating a workshop there are times
when i'm creating it and i have a very
clear direction of where i want everyone
to go and i know exactly how to get them
there and and i'm going to walk them
through
that and get them where they need to go
there's less story
there but if i'm looking for for
everyone to explore
and we're all trying to figure out
what's going on um then i'm going to be
looking for stories i want to pull
stories out so i think you know i think
um
i think we i just go back to using the
word the traditional version is also
fine but it's also helped us today to
explore
the different ways in which
humans interact with each other and
potentially could interact with
technology and that's been really
valuable
uh zeke you want to say something
i was just looking at the definition of
story
um
i think it's funny how there's so many
definitions that's why one of the qualms
i have about the english language is
it's just a little bit finicky um
and uh
you know i just think of story as like
metadata
i guess i've been so much in the back
end of this stuff and thinking about it
from a very technical
perspective so
i just think of like information about
information
and i just think of like overlap like
hollandic overlap for shared meaning
context
but this is very interesting to me this
is the kind of stuff that i've been
exploring at great length for quite some
time
again how it relates to the backend for
these different technologies using
distributed
web architecture and various frameworks
for helping these different tools
connect and interoperate so that's like
this is the main thing i'm kind of
diving into i'd say right now so this is
cool that we're having this conversation
i'm grateful to be a part of this um
you know one thing that did come to mind
for me was so when i was learning about
history and i got into different
religions and you know archaeology and
things like that
the word myth
we intuitively a lot of us or at least
me and the people i grew up with
myth was like made up it was false or it
was kind of
elaborated or fabricated to some kind of
context but when you look at the
original
epidemiology of it
it just means story
and so that's what's that's what kind of
came to mind all this is just the mythos
and
um i think that that is inherently
probably going to have meaning different
meaning to each individual you know what
their individual mythos is along with
their perspective
and you know their community so
this idea of perspectives is quite
interesting to me because you know
having gone down the physics rabbit hole
and stuff like that it's like
you know you've said they've done
different these like supposedly they've
done these different stories like they
have the brain games and all that and uh
you know you can have 20 people see an
event and you're getting 20 different
accounts of that event and a couple days
go by and now all of a sudden the
details have changed
so i mean that that kind of is a little
more on the
abstract theory side of things of like
what is reality but
um you know i just wanted to share like
those were the things that kind of like
came to mind uh when y'all were speaking
i love i love that you just went to like
mythos and
that perspective and physics i mean for
me that's
i've gone to all those places too
and it's fascinating how they kind of
all land in the in in similar spots
right that
we shape our perspective our perspective
is shaped by our past and our habits and
everything that's around us and so
the challenge i think for that i have
tried to play with
in creating something useful and
imagining something useful made out of
technology is how do we allow for all
those possibilities in one interface
which drives me crazy and at the same
time that's why to me the networked view
of things works so well
because i can make it what i want it to
be and it can be that three layered
or 3d layered you know multi-layered
things so i can make the associations
that make sense to me where it gets
dicey is where you know sometimes this
group is i think it's been here
talked before about okay there's my
version of things because this is my
beliefs or these are this is my
background or this is my perspective on
how i'd like to connect to this
information
and then there's a big gray area like
i'm like okay i draw a circle around
myself and then there's like this big
huge swath of gray area that is
what i think is opposed to what you
think what i think is a variation on
what you think what i think is you know
it comes at it from a different angle or
whatever right and that's a huge gray
areas how do we play together in that
space in a way that makes sense and
isn't so complicated that nobody wants
to be there ever and then there's this
stuff on the outside of that yeah we
pretty much all agree that this is
either fact or truth or information that
everybody the berries are still there a
year later like it's still
you know the berries and they're there
and that's it right so
the gray area is the interesting part
and the hardest part to me um and how
and that's the collaborative part
and allowing for each of us to navigate
our way through that gray area in a way
that makes provides meaning to me my
individual life or in the life of my
family or my community
is
i think
designing something that's flexible
enough that doesn't have
allows for
those different perspectives i guess and
doesn't you know and here's where we
start to get into the realm of like
where biases are and where and how do we
visualize how do we help people by
visualizing those differences in my mind
i started to do crowdsourcing things i
started to do
you know going hey if there was a piece
of information we could all even even
here's the base in title of something
and hear all the parts underneath
could we all start to
collaborate on yeah most of us think
that this is a great definition and most
of us think that this is a great
resource and most of us think this is
the best book and most of us write and
and yet still allow for the fringe
things to be there it's it's to me
that's where i'm playing right now is
trying to
yeah and i knew that i could if i
couldn't even get like baseline me
collective knowledge that we all kind of
agree upon if i can't even get that then
the gray area is like you know we're
never then
we can't even we can't even start
talking about the gray area
zeke go ahead don't wait for me because
um i've gotten plenty of air time and
you're just getting to speak up
okay thanks i just wanted to address
back to that real quick um
well the dream that had come to me was
actually
you can have multiple uis but it's a
shared backend it's the shared
distributed database
um and really customizable uis so like
uh
where we're getting at is with these new
types of technologies you can um
you can you can kind of like move the
pieces around as it makes sense to you
uh initially of course until ai gets a
little more advanced or at least
integrated
into this
you know it could be a template so you
could put the thing in the upper right
hand corner upper left lower left lower
right and those are options but you can
still move it amongst those four pieces
so because the way the different brains
are wired the way culturally there's a
lot of reasons that you know people are
going to interact with things
differently might even change according
to mood
so some people i know are playing around
with kind of like
bio field sensing technology
and those kinds of things so that's kind
of cool to think about how that might
influence
these different dynamics
so i i envision really
shared databases shared backends
and but then it can be multiple
different forms of presentation but at
least you've now bridged those silos
between you don't have to have 25 apps
you you can have one app it's almost
like
downloading an os client i guess right
yeah
it's cool stuff to think about how this
might you know
come about
and uh
and then the other really important
thing that i think
this in my opinion is
this idea of being resistant to civil
attacks
meaning multiple fake accounts i think
that's a huge problem right now of
accountability is the fact that people
can go and just say a bunch of stuff or
act a certain way and they can do so
kind of behind this like scene of
anonymity but as soon as you bring more
of these things to light people are now
much more highly incentivized to be be
careful and scrutinize their behavior
and the the information that they share
so i think having um ways in which you
can have you know verifiably unique
accounts
you know you don't necessarily have to
share all the information about that
underlying account you you can you don't
necessarily know who they are you don't
have to know who they are you can if you
want that in the rules of your network
but
you at least know that they're
verifiably unique like that that
account's actions
has meaning so if you could imagine
you know your reputation or behavior
whatever you want to call it an uber
affects the grocery store affects the
restaurant and then now you could filter
reviews that you want to read based on
those scores and you know it's more
customizable if you want to go and
search
for things you can you know basically
decide what's important to you what
metrics
of measurement you know matter and the
information that you want to access
i hope that's a
good way to describe it
yeah and i want it and and you know
thinking about how
um
i mean we we talk about this in various
groups of us just that that
you know wanting the shared um
the shared library of of
um
data and all the different ways of
looking at it whether it's in a wiki and
a map and you know by association with
people
by association with topics
by you know
um
[Music]
you know just being able to filter
um in
in different front ends and
within different front ends in different
ways
um
yeah
that's the kind of interoperability i
think you know we're
all striving for um so you're gonna
build the back end for us
you got you got that you got that part
knocked i'm working on it right now as
we speak
okay
let's talk
um
i just also wanted to say something
about the the um
myth making
um
[Music]
the myth
i'll go back to container um for
um for certain sets of facts
that you know individually
as when wendy as you were saying you
know you come up with your own
belief set
and
and as groups we do as religions we do
you know the
sun you know rises in east and sets in
the west and the
myth that's built around that of the you
know
um you know pick your you know uh
aboriginal
you know story of the wolf swallowing
the sun and da da da da you know
um
that
we do that and you know in modern day we
also do that in a way where
like oh these these facts
don't fit with the
mythology i already
you know constructed and therefore i'm
not going to include them
um
but if if
everybody has
access to all the
i i'm
you know i have the problem of do you
call them facts even all the all the
the
the possible data points within
somebody's story
are
and the metadata attached to them
[Music]
is all accessible to anybody who is
looking at their own story constructing
a story knowing what pieces of a story
um
[Music]
you know
are questionable i mean if you want to
lead anybody you know we always have
this problem of like can you really
can you really change somebody's mind by
attacking their story um you know
they're going to want to defend their
story but if anybody on their own
can see
what parts of their story
have
different stories attached to them
that
don't
don't negate
the fact that this piece of their story
exists
but provide
other
related explanations
that might be able to bend their
thinking a little bit or at least open
themselves up to
maybe this thing can be seen a different
way you know maybe there's a scientific
explanation for the sun coming up in the
east and setting in the west
i mean it's it it's
yeah i don't know where i'm going with
this but
but i just like you know the story as
container
i i come back to and and like let's let
um
data points that don't have stories
around them exist
i i guess i guess part of what i'm what
i'm trying to say is like
trying to think of a framework in which
it's okay for a fact to be
a data point to be part of a story it's
okay for it not to be part of the story
it's okay for it to be part of multiple
stories and we all get visibility on all
of that
um if if we
want it
and we can also filter out like you know
i'm just interested in recipes for these
berries i don't care about the the myths
and the tigers and the location where
they came i don't i don't want any of
that please just show me recipes and you
don't see all that stuff
yeah i think you said it all i can't
even remember what i was going to say
now
[Laughter]
um
yeah i think one of the things i was i
was going to say somewhere in there is
you know there's the myth of the hero's
journey right and and with which is
joseph campbell not your head if you
know of joseph campbell and all this
okay so everybody's familiar okay so
when you start looking at how often the
humans retell that story
and it's
million literally millions of versions
of this story you know and here joseph
campbell tried to break it down and put
it into parts and give us give us a
schema from which to follow along if we
want to build this story or understand
it better and it's really really useful
and then to michael's point yeah but
sometimes i just need some berries and
do we need to go through a whole hero's
journey to find the berries
no right so again i think there's
there's an opportunity if we're if we're
in trauma
we need to tell stories
if we're in therapy we need space held
for stories and how do we come oh yeah
this is the other thing so when you have
two people who who conflict on their
version of truth
and it seems diametrically opposed
pretty much everybody agrees that the
way to get through that is to find
connection
right so
what if we had a platform that helped us
to build connection right so it's the
same database it's the same data
it it's we are now but the visual then
shows these two things are currently
opposed and now here's a little
intersection and people start working on
well where's the intersection between
those two things right here right here
in between the in between space right
and so even if these two sections
seemingly get more and more
diametrically opposed it turns out that
everyone likes puppies right or whatever
you know it's it's and i think that
that's where
um
massive wiki is helping right like any
time we're building connections it's a
very human thing that brings us that's
how we're wired right it brings us we
don't always need a story or we need we
don't always need to know that we're
building a story even if we are we need
to build connections to me that's the
key stories do that really really well
because they elicit emotion and emotion
elicits connection but
i mean the connection be built in and
myriads of ways and um and it breaks
down barriers it breaks down silos
between people between information
between it's about so to me it's about
the connections
in the end
yeah and then and then back to what you
were saying zeke one database helps to
build connections faster
by its very nature and my
my estimation right because you're not
now we're not all slowed down the whole
system doesn't slow down and go okay but
this connect this system doesn't talk to
that system okay well two years of
development and
a million headaches later now we can
finally send two pieces of information
across to each other right it's not the
point is right to facilitate all of that
um yes
how do we do that
we needed that yesterday
i'm sure that every single developer in
the entire history of the internet has
been saying how do we you know how do we
get these two pieces of information on
the same database are you familiar with
uh self-hosting cloud hosting
yeah
just from a user perspective not from a
tackle technical perspective right now
our information
you send a text to your family friend
and that's now seen in 10 000 databases
across the world
so those are centralized servers giant
big warehouse buildings with just stacks
and stacks of servers and an it team and
all that stuff so
taking that
and giving a slice to the individual
allowing them to plug in a
device that uses the same amount of
electricity as your hard drive would on
like full capacity or whatever so much
less than mining
crypto or anything like that but then um
you're sharing different instances of
these applications
across
a large range of nodes
but now you have a distributed database
i believe that that's
one possible solution um potentially
where
you know um there's there's always going
to be
fractally divided i want to sit in silos
but they don't necessarily have to
function so much like silos it's more i
think of them as like permissioned
membranes permission servers right
um but still like it's so cool because
the the way that they can access the
data it doesn't require global consensus
but you could still find you can still
very readily identify
where
where there's that overlap kind of how
you were talking about there's the core
and then there's the peripheral gray
area but it
should in theory i would think allow us
to identify where we have the most
overlap in our in our data in our shared
data right
i'm really uh
um
i really like
permissioning
um
[Music]
decentralization and permissioning
you know coming up out of that i'm not
sure i followed everything that you were
saying but the idea
that
um
well the the the holy grail that
um we all have
all of our own information
on our own
hard drives and the ability
to
permission it outwards in myriad ways
um
saying like i want this specific piece
of information to be shared with this
one person
to
i want this
data i've gary gathered about
you know berries in this location
to be
shared
globally
but without
specific attribution to me
except as somebody who was
a first degree witness to the berries
existing in that place
as a as a for instance
that just
um
you know that that that control of
permissioning
um and
permissioning as container
yeah what the internet was supposed to
be she mentioned tim generously and his
original dream what his original vision
of the internet was supposed to be
um so we we can self-host our
applications so
you know we're we are hosting we are
hosting our own data it's not going
through it's no longer going through
that centralized
database
so that allows for
i mean there's tons of challenges of
course obstacles that come with that
especially for security um but you know
it
should be much quicker in theory things
could be a lot more lightweight you
wouldn't need as many lines of codes you
wouldn't need as many calls and things
like that um so and also should open up
the door for
um just the ability to see the different
perspectives so you can kind of like you
know get a better idea of more of a
compilation of
what this server over here is seeing or
doing and so on so you get a variety of
the different perspectives as to what's
going on
and then ultimately you know once
artificial super intelligence arrives
sometime
whenever that is um
now you're talking about literally like
a cloud you know like the robot sophia's
brain like it's just the cloud is like
in her brain whatever it is you know
that part is scary maybe but
just if you look at
the idea of an intentional intelligence
programmable intelligence it's the
ability of what it can allow us to do
with a lot of automated processing and
handling of data so one of the things
that the reason i'm sharing is one of
the things i'm very interested in is
this idea of oracles so oracle's is like
a box like a black box you put an input
and then it gives you an output so it's
like basically an automated function
and so i could see these different
functions being able to kind of gather
data so it's not like a human
necessarily that has to like enter in
this data in this database and organize
it but it's it's more of a
conglomeration i'm sure like big tech
companies are already using that now i
mean governments for sure have to be
using it but allowing those same
technologies that they have
that's you know um proprietary and
giving that to the people i think could
really open up the floodgates for like
for what we're talking about um i don't
know how that's possible but that's just
like
what that's what i'm hoping can happen
at some point
yes so going back to the privacy piece
for a second
when i started to envision okay this is
my store of knowledge and i started to
talk to people about
privacy issues around that
it both
frightens people but also
open doors too right like if they're if
we really could trust that the thing i'm
creating for my curating knowledge for
myself it can be private because i'm
storing it here it's next to me i only
give permission to people who i give
permission to access it
then a whole host of things becomes
possible right now i'm not just storing
knowledge like the berries right i'm
stirring knowledge that is
that i am
extremely aware i want to keep private
i'm working on something brand new
someone someone could take it and run
with it and i'm not ready to publish it
yet could be one which is knowledge
based but what about medical based what
about financial based what about right
all those other ways in which right now
a lot of my data is sitting somewhere
else which you know it has to sit with
like a high wall around it and i i
barely can get access to it what if i
owned that and i could start making
associations between
the things that i already know about my
own financial or medical situation and
that uh the other space out there right
where it's just the shared knowledge
station i can dip in and out of those
two and go oh wow this is a diagnosis
that i just received or these are
symptoms i have or this is my past
history and what's you know what can i
learn from the from the
the the
knowledge network from the public
knowledge network sphere about myself
and ooh that's interesting save it down
oh that's interesting save it down ooh
that's interesting save it down you know
what and these five things over here are
kind of interesting too but let me save
them for later and let me curate it in a
way that i can find it when i want it
right so to me it
opens the door to
us as humans re-owning our own story you
might say or our own knowledge and being
able to use technology for that benefit
of knowing ourselves better in a world
that
in in our lifetimes we come across
i don't know what the factor is of the
amount of information we now come across
and have access to in comparison to just
say two generations ago and
we but our brains can't
hold it much more than we used right so
let's use technology to hold it and help
us help facilitate that thinking really
take advantage of all that's available
to us it's super cool and i don't think
it's really possible unless we can lock
it thus we as individuals can trust that
it's locked in a safe place i'll always
be a little nervous
right and i always won't want to put up
the most important pieces of my life on
this thing unless i know it's really
safe and so this is to me this is huge
it's foundation part of the reason why
i'm struggling i struggled for years to
develop it because i kind of want to
wait for that technology to come up
because i don't want to develop it twice
i'm
[Music]
i'm hearing what you're saying and
resonating and
and um
and also um thinking about the
you know we want to feel secure
and yet
our
our you know identities can be
um stolen and our our you know our
finances
our financial records can be hacked and
you know people probably don't want to
get at our medical records but certainly
you know when they're in somebody else's
hands we're worried about that and um
that security piece is
you know what's under our control we can
govern but there's so much that's not
under our control
um
yeah
and and just to circle back to something
you were saying
zeke
actually i don't remember who was saying
this but just about
the
yeah i think it was easy talking about
um
you know oracles and and um
you know
general intelligence when it comes to be
um
like
being able to just the way that we
construct
mythologies and stories and and
explanations and scientific theories
around
um facts
to be able to
loose
um
a general intelligence an oracle you
know something on a set of facts
that we don't even know what we want to
make of
um
but just to like say
you know maybe not be smart enough to
have a point of view um but more say
here's a possible explanation that fits
all these facts together
um or these data points which may or may
not be facts
um and and
you know this one makes sense of
like
90 of the 100 facts you put in here but
these 10 would disprove it so maybe it's
worth concentrating on
whether these 10
are in fact
you know accurate
um because if they're not then then this
all works but if you know those to be
true then this whole thing falls apart
um
yeah i mean you know general access to
all of those
data points
um in the same language you know
including
the snake photos in the garden on
facebook
want to get there
and the cool thing with the internet of
things we're going to have access to
large amounts of data like never before
so that hopefully will help this process
because we'll just have access to
they're going to have all these little
sensors on everything you're just going
to be uploading tons and tons of data
constantly all the time about a bunch of
stuff
that's going to be really cool and then
just having it so that we can compile
that data and design
algorithms in which the machine can you
know start learning about it and trying
to piece it together and then it
presents us
says hey you know got all this like
these are the 90 these are the 10 and
here's like some stuff and what it could
mean and these are other people that are
you know doing the same thing and
reading and learning about this and so
it just can present to you and then you
can say like you can even you know
teach it it's like machine learning
human human guided machine learning
makes a lot of sense so yeah that was
helpful no that wasn't helpful let's put
that aside for later and then it and you
know tag it if something else comes up
let me know pop up a notification
stuff like that um so it's really cool
to think about the fact that like right
now we don't have yet all these sensors
and all this like data get
access to potential data but once that's
available then that that i think can
open up a lot of
a lot of possibilities too
and
that brings me to the fears that we all
have and that you know are are realized
and true about um the monitoring of the
data that we generate
by
third parties by you know the amazons
and the googles and the you know the
the ad targeting um algorithms that we
feel uncomfortable about and we want
control over
um and when you think about you know iot
stuff you think oh my god is you know my
vacuum cleaner going to be eavesdropping
on my conversation so amazon can like
you know
change the pricing on something because
they know i really want it
um and
if
if we
felt confident that we all individually
had
you know control of that stuff on our
own servers and shared it voluntarily
like i'm fine with sharing
you know the chemical analysis of the
dust in my house
um via my vacuum cleaner with you know
academic institutions that are you know
looking at
the migratory habits of different
animals and can tell from you know other
there's all kinds of stuff that you'd be
cool with if you knew yeah all right
fine i'm i'm up for that i'm down for
that here's my data you can you can have
a constant
monitoring of the flow of data from my
vacuum cleaner you know
this research program
it would be a lot different than god
don't let anybody see anything because i
don't know what they're doing with it
that's right yeah and it'd be really
cool to know what people are doing with
it to see how useful it's been it
encourages you to write to then give
more
data to the right people too is key so
yeah that's cool i agree
if people are willing i just want to
flip this on its head for a second so
we're talking about the edges of
where this could go which is super cool
and then it's reminding me of an article
i read yesterday which is
the simple the simplest version of this
and how it could be immensely useful
right now
which is reading this article and i've
been thinking a lot about phantom work
we were talking about this last week
right michael can't remember okay so i
read a really good article about um
written by it was in the atlantic i can
post it if you guys want to
um
want to read it um from a woman who
writes often about um the social um
the government's projects and um
and solutions for
supporting the social structure of
society right so it could be like
helping somebody with homelessness or
helping somebody get
money from the government who they were
promised because of kova 19 issues or
whatever right any any of those kind of
programs and she's saying she got to a
point where she you know obviously
there's always red tape obviously
there's always
too many forms to fill out all the rest
but she's got to a point where she
started noticing after reporting on it
for years and years maybe this was about
i'm guessing now about five years ago or
something she started to recognize that
wow this has gotten to a whole new level
of complicated and does it really need
to be this complicated there's such uh
so much friction for people who are need
help to get the help that they need
whether it's in healthcare and making a
million phone calls to your insurance
company when you're ill or it's you know
not you know homelessness and making
having to fill out forms with random
questions that make absolutely no sense
to anybody under any circumstances in
order to just have a meeting with
somebody and she pointed out some very
clear examples
of how this works and so i just think
it's interesting i think that it you
know just having a knowledge repository
we're not even talking about personal
now we're not even talking about the
gray area and we're not even talking
about the future of what's possible
we're talking about that public
knowledge store that could be and that
with the time and attention of people
who have the time and attention to give
could be immensely useful to the people
who don't have the time and attention to
give who either you know are ill or
don't have the money the resources the
time the energy the whatever
and she talked about how those things
used to be done by a government agency
there's really no quality control in
anymore so now teachers are doing that
work and social workers are doing that
work and other you know nonprofit
agencies are doing the work of trying to
help individuals get to what they need
and get through the system to what they
need
so it's just interesting to me um
as a as a thought exercise and maybe
also as a good
test case too
in terms of trying to get information to
the right people
at the right time in the right place
when they need it um it's low-hanging
fruit in terms of solutions
solution finding you know here's the
solution here's how to get through it
here's an organization they'll help you
navigate through it you know at least
you have the information at the
baseline
just as a thought
thanks peter that's the one
was it you that posted it to mattermost
so did someone post to mattermost is
that how i ended up with it because i
can't even remember um i i didn't start
with it um i i grabbed the link i found
the link after somebody had mentioned it
i think maybe it was you

nice to meet you yeah i really
appreciate this conversation this was
amazing
thank you all for doing what you're
doing and being you
it's great
yeah you too i think um we'd all agree

everyone and that if you're interested
in working with us on
i'm trying to figure this out we are
very much
welcoming of your time and talents
awesome thank you yeah and love to know
what you're doing and and you know how
we can support you
cool thank you yeah
very excited to um get connected so just
let me know
cool
i think you know about madame rest and
yeah you do
yeah i'm not i haven't been using it but
i'm familiar i can hop on there this uh
i did this i'm the one that i'll hop on
anything whatever app people are using
i'll jump in there just uh i don't have
experience with any of these things i
haven't used social media in like a
decade literally so
um there's a lot of things i'm just not
going to know about like current events
and stuff so keep that in mind also like
i just may struggle to like figure out
how to use some of these things but i'm
very curious to hear people's opinions
on what they like and don't like about
certain uh software and applications
because
i didn't realize i'd end up being in
this where i am now designing it but i
am so i need to kind of know now like
what's what's out there so
there's a uh so
the mana most is um where this community
uh kind of hangs out when we're not on
calls
um in the flotilla channel um there's
another channel you might be interested
in which is
synergic social media
which is kind of somebody who's
working on
a
less
unvirtuous uh
social media
um but it's it's also kind of a general
you you might have some good
conversations there about what's good
and bad about different different social
media
platforms
yeah yeah that'd be great just um
yeah and go dm me that info and i'll hop
in there
and feel free again as michael was
saying to post whatever questions you
have to i found i'm pretty new to to
this experience as well with everyone
else and collaboration so
i've found i can just speak to my own
experiences saying i found that if you
post a question there's plenty of people
who will be willing to to chime in in a
very supportive way to um to either you
know
bring your attention to resources you
didn't know or
you know answer the question directly or
whatever so however we can support you
is what i'm getting at yeah great thank
you so much
this is uh this is bigger than us you
know
it's really cool it's great it's really
great to meet people like yourselves
you're too my husband came down i had
you guys on on you and i'm making my
lunch and he's he just leans in he goes
i can't even like
you can say that but i just
not everyone likes to have these
conversations and i would try to have
them with him and he'd be like please i
have a headache like i just
he runs he runs software in his day job
too he's a vp of pimsleur which is a
language learning you know he's
developed their app and you know so he's
like i can i can't i can't you know and
um and i'm like please i really wanna
this stuff is great
it's just nice to have it have a forum
talk about it with other people who are
interested and we all see the potential
because it's heavy topics we start
talking about we get into and um you
know i know at times it can really weigh
me down and give me compassion fatigue
so um it's nice to have be in an
environment with people who feel like
there's a path through
so thank you thank you for always
holding this space and
it's been great
thanks all have a great weekend have a
great day great weekend see ya
