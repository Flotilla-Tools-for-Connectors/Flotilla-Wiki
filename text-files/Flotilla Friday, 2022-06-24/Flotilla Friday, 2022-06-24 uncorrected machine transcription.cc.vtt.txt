00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I was just relating that that I had a a misadvantage recently.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Mostly my my fault. user error. but a little bit of a sharp edge on the tool with a tool called crab fit, which is a replacement, for when well, not a replacement, an alternative to when to meet and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
some other services scheduling poll. So after I kind of straightened down and said, Okay, I made a new poll.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I A little bit later, I said, and I made 2 issues in the open source.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Repo for it, and stacy's like Well, that is that's cool.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Is that a open source thing or do you happen to know these people, and that's why you got involved it's It's actually literally an open source thing.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's it's a a kind of a highest complement, and and also seen as very contributory to a project to make a good bug report or a good issue enhancement.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Request. So I you know I feel like I contributed to their project.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I I also feel a little bit guilty that I didn't contribute code or something like that.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But for an open source project. the the the way that you participate is by constructive criticism is one of the highest forms of contributing to a thing not quite as high as as documenting something that

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:49.000
isn't documented or even better fixing the bug and and saying, here's a fix for the bug that I have, you know, and and you could use it if you want can I can I just say that I think

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
it's usually valuable the fact that we're using it, and we're sharing it, and that people know about it.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I mean I don't think that should be overlooked at all.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Yeah, you know the So. So when I when I made those enhancement requests are actually enhancement request.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Did they? They have a a thing, you know. Do you want to do an enhancement request or a bugle part?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And so I clicked enhancement requests because they weren't bugs.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So then another another good practice is for me to go.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Read all the bug reports and it enhancement requests. even the ones that are have been fixed and go. okay.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It's not that one. it's not that one to make sure that i'm not duplicating right in the in the process of doing that One of the ones that that I I referenced did have a comment where he said

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
you know. by the way, this tool is wonderful and it's awesome you know.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Thank you so much for for creating it I felt a little bit weird I didn't do that.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
A lot of times I will but it's it's also it it.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It feels good as a maintainer when I get those kind of comments.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's always wonderful, but it also I it also junks up the enhancement request or the the Bug report a little bit to put a just a random compliment in it.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So I decided not to, for whatever reason and I I kind of in my head, I've got a social debt, you know to, you know.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Hit them on Twitter, or something like that. and say by the way we were using crab fit, and you know the experience has been awesome or something like that.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So that's I have the intent to do that even even if I don't the so

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So there's a really cool long essay that explains some of this it's some of it is ancient and no longer relevant, but some of it is really relevant and it's a really good piece

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I'm thinking about in the beginning was the command line with by Neil Stevenson.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I'm not sure I can recommend the whole thing I think maybe i'll what i'll do is find the interesting bits.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But he talks about it's. it's about the difference between largely it's about the difference between mediated experiences and raw experiences.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So he makes the the distinction between you're traping through the jungle of India, and you come across some stone ruins, and you get to experience the whole thing versus you're you're in Orlando

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Florida at Disney World, and you stumble across some ruins, and they look even more authentic than the real ruins.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Because Disney, is that an awesome job of kind of like setting the stage, getting you emotionally ready for it, you know, replicating it, and then amping up a little bit.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:55.000
The the whole experience of ancient ruins. Right? So he uses that kind of metaphor to talk about interfaces to computers.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So we are, we're all using a windows fancy windows interface with a lot of affordances that make the computer quote unquote easier to use it.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Also an easier interface strips away as some of the the power of of the computer.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So at least 3 of us here, I think, also pull up a pretend version of the old way that we used to interface with computers versus via the command line and then we have the power of the command.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Line and the power of the Gui interface, so the whole.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:43.000
The whole thing is about in the beginning with the command line here's these 2 ways of approaching power and ease of use, and in that he talks about the difference between linux an open source system and microsoft

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
windows. a closed source system closed our system like windows has to pretend that it's perfect.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So you'll never hear microsoft saying Oh, windows is broken in these ways.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Please don't use it for those things linux on the other hand, he's he loves the fact.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Stevenson loves the fact that you come to linux, and pretty much the first thing you're blasted with Here are all the bugs.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Here is all the ways that it's horrible here's all the you know. and he says you know so what happens in an open source.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Environment is you know the context of the tool that you're using and you can participate in in talking about it's shortcomings, and you can help improve it and stuff like that.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And so it gets better and better and more fit to purpose.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Over time windows. the feedback loops are broken.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:40.000
They can admit that there's anything wrong so they hide a bunch of stuff, and they keep building craft on top of that like to hide the fact that it's not working, and it gets bloated and ugly and

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
hard to use, and and nobody can admit that it's hard to use.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And so it just gets ugly and uglier So that's the part of the story that I wanted to kind of convey and maybe I can find enough of that encapsulated in the the essay that I can

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
say here read this part. I read that part as I mentioned in the Chat.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000
There's the first of the essays and travels in hyper reality. Biomimico goes real.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
There goes deeply into the the ruin situation. You described it. Co.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Incidentally also wrote this hilarious piece about operating systems as religion.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Do you remember that one where he compares Mac with Catholicism and windows, would pretend participantism?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And at some point I think unix was Talmudic and the the it's it's a great piece, hey? go it! who has some, as you extremely sharp commentary on so many things but I remember the

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:05.000
the piece about. I think he was referencing Disney. but wax museums where, for example, there's a reproduction of the Venus of Milo, and Of course cause it's a wax

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:18.000
museum they have the full statue with arms because you know they wouldn't have been broken to start with, and it's in full color, because well, actually, in this case it's defensible that it was originally painted to

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:31.000
start with it. wasn't white marble and and he said on the one hand, it's it was there's a he He gave 2 slogans.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Is that it has to be the real thing, but then it has to be something more, and he says, those are the 2 principles of American aesthetics.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Up to a point about some of these things and the real thing.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I, we have to give you the real But no we have to get you to something more than the real thing. and that's what she called hyper reality, partly following both of the yeah, Stacy yeah.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Just as this relates to in math weavers the idea we were talking.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I mean we weren't talking about yet we're supposed to be talking about interviewing projects as if they were people I love the way this conversations amorphousizing these projects, and giving them personality because it kind of will match and

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
help to describe the personalities needed to work in such an environment.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I mean if you don't want to work in that environment you can't be that type of person either

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Okay, should we do around there's something i'd like to discuss, But I want to give other people chance to propose topics as well.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
We should go around. Yep, you should go first, my good one.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Okay, So I really want to dig into what is needed for he stocks to flow tooling.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And I may want to dig into data models and a lot of the complex requirements.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.000
If people are interested in that, but it's very much a little bit rough standpoint, more about stocks and those tools.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I think a lot of us are interested in So stocks and flows of information.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Yeah. translating conversation processes which such as videos, transcripts thereof, and anything like that into something more synthetic which would be the stock.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So the conversations, the flow ideas pass by or it can be chat Interfaces are where it whatever is for found lead time, balance versus something that is more synthetic, and says, well, here's a that serves in a way

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
as an index into all the conversations but allows all sorts of okay, what's being said?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:13.000
What decisions have been taken what's the current state of things and may or may not be you know.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And and and translating one to another is work it's very serious work.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:31.000
But how do we do it in a way that's ecosystemic? And how do we do it?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:39.000
In a way that's not 2 up in united about tooling but also a allows interrupt.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So that's my topic and let's round other topics

00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Jonathan you're muted

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Oh, oh, throw out I mean in this is just something spurred by what you were saying, Mark Antoine, that the

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Granularization, the segmentation of of sequential things like, you know, conversations, chats, email chains.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:13:08.000
You know discussions that we're having you know I I think it's sort of a necessary prerequisite in a way that you'd be able to look at pieces so to recombine for relevance

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and and of course a lower a lower barred it's a more mechanical function.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:24.000
But I think it's a really valuable one you know we've got transcripts

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Ways that we could manually or non manually chop those up and search them.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Is is a question that comes to mind, and of course, how we can do that in a somewhat flat, interoperable way.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So you know nothing too big or difficult

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Absolutely no, that's the topic I want to discuss before we dig into it. more.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Let's see if we can elicit any more conversations I haven't been watching Jonathan Is Is he doing other stuff, or I think he's trying to figure out how to unmute?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
He was unmuted at some point but we still didn't hear it real quick.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:26.000
F. 2 F. means face to face. Thank you.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Throughout one other subject, while we're waiting for jonathan that that is perennial and and I was thinking about how to approach it from a different angle.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:15:16.000
That the idea of using you're using using high low you know, in the context of work we're doing here, and the Meta project was raised, and oh, just the question of how we hello, and you know, take take this

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:38.000
test case just to say, this is how we allow information to manifest itself in different ways on different platforms.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:48.000
From the work we're doing

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Not not privileging in one platform over another it's Is that how to decide what platform to use?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Well how not to decide what platform to use is is what I'm saying, I mean how to.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:17.000
How do you act in interruptable enough ways to

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Not say

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Where choosing high, low, and therefore unchoosing catalyst, or seriously, or you know Yup,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Yeah, I I like that, I I I have to say, without getting into the topic itself.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:17:00.000
One of my heuristics for tools for project management, for instance, is the best tool for project management is whatever tool the project manager feels most comfortable with.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
So that one is a it's a bit of a spoiler.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:12.000
It's not quite like a collaborative tool like matter most or highlight, or matrix, or something like that where everybody has to participate in it.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
It's a tool where one person has to participate and everybody has to follow along.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:26.000
But in those cases you know the heuristic that let's let's use a tool that everybody likes is really bad.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Because if it's not a tool that the program project manager likes, they're not gonna use it very well.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:50.000
So I guess maybe I I can use another i'll add another bullet to that which is tools where everybody needs to use it equally

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
That's indicated where we have program program manager but I even agree.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
It's important it a a and well, and this is why I care about interrupt right?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.000
What I would like is a tool where everybody can use whatever they want, and it flows into whatever tool to project.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Manager wants to use that would be the ideal case.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Yes, did it? and that's kind of the That's that's always been the the flotilla line, you know.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Let's let's use massive wiki and let's use catalyst and let's see this factor, and let's use silo and let's use you know and then make sure they can all talk to each

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
other

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Okay, so should I get started I Don't think Jonathan is managing to join us.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Unfortunately. yes, yes, I agree. and everybody's good with the the definitions of stocks and flows.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:12.000
I could use some clarification on exactly what stocks the how you would define Star one of the one of the ways to think of it is water.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.000
So flows our way. the water's moving and stocks are when the water is still like a lake.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Another way to think of it is in a factory floor.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Flows are where pieces and parts and finish things are moving, and stocks is like a stockpile.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:40.000
So if i've got to insert you know bracket bracket, 1, 2, 3 into the large superstructure.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
I'm working on. if I have a stock of bracket, 1, 2, 3 behind me.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Then I can grab one and put it if I don't have a stock behind me.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:56.000
If it's always in flow i've got the problem that i'm waiting for the person to hand me bracket 1, 2, 3, before I can do anything.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
The flip side, though. and this is the Toyota production system.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.000
The trick is if I have a 1 billion bracket 1, 2, 3 is behind me.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Somebody had to make all those we have to figure out the factory floor space to accommodate all those we have to figure out a way to move the ones and back towards me.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:25.000
When I I you know. So stocks were found to be inefficient in lean production, and they tried to operate on flows. And just in time.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Manufacturing is a, you know, optimizing for flow and something that in computer science we call back pressure to tell an incoming flow.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Wait. i'm. not ready to receive this because i'm processing other stuff.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Yeah, and and conversely i'm i'm waiting on you.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Now you know, please give me what you've got so that we can keep the whole thing flowing.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:58.000
The The visual visual combine cards are actually meant to be forward pressure and back pressure signals to the upstream.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Interestingly enough, makes perfect sense the the the i'm sorry.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:16.000
My metaphor is a river with logs and I mean for me the conversation is like there's all these interesting pieces of ideas floating on the river of the conversation.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:29.000
But I want to take the logs. out of the river and build the cabin that's and that means so in that example. the logs are the flow, not the water, the logs are either flowing or they've they've

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:37.000
been curated. they've been harvested and encompassed and collected into a log cabin.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:47.000
So I guess my question is, what is the when I mean as opposed to a manufacturing line?

00:21:47.000 --> 00:22:00.000
An information flow we're the stucks that we're making of them are the cabin in a way.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:10.000
It's not that they're they're fundable you know identical parts that they need to be identified as they flow.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:19.000
And and evaluated verified That is a hard problem.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:37.000
That is the hard problem. Yes, those unadidentified logs as part of the flow and the removed curated version as stocks.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:45.000
That's why I was just asking about the definition , because I know I know what you mean. I mean, Pete.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Your definition makes total sense in in the physical world. I I think Mark and Chuan has done something interesting with a metaphor, and I wish I knew my argumentation and conversation theory well enough to call it autonomy or something like

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000
that. but But I think Mark and Fund typically stock stocks and flows are commodity kinds of things.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:14.000
I everything the same like water or like bracket 1 2 3 so it's it's kind of an interesting extension of the metaphor to talk about.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:25.000
He's he's using he's using that metaphor to talk, talk about the way things you know they're They're either flowing, they're real-time conversation and things are going fast and you can't

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
grab on anything, or they've accumulated in one place but but there is a shape to them.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
The things that are flowing have different shapes, different concepts and thoughts and things.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
You know things like that. and then when you build them into something different.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.000
People might build it differently. The components of it aren't aren't plug and play like a log or bracket.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
They have, you know, interesting shapes and stuff like that.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Yeah, it It's interesting that you brought in factory aligned because it's not what I had in my mind.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:15.000
But you're absolutely right when people say stock and flow that is the most common reference, and and and i'm very much thinking about, you know the the paradox of transforming meaningful conversations into meaningful documents because

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
nobody's going to listen to the bloody conversation again another nobody.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000
A lot of people do, but i'm the usually the one complaining about.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Don't send me videos or Youtube. I won't listen to them I want something written.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:43.000
I want something concise, and if I want to dig in i'll dig in, make it fractal But I don't want to listen to a 90 min conversation, because there might be something interesting in There It's 90 min.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:53.000
I can skin the 90 min transcript in roughly 5 min in the extract relevant nuggets for me which might not be the same.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Not gets it, you will find relevant. but do you?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.000
And in that instance market, and what you really want is that I don't know.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:23.000
What it is in the in stock slow terms. But The the granularity view on what's in that video to be able to say, Oh, there are there 12 videos out there.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:31.000
This one has 0 instances of the thing i'm interested in this one has 5, and there are these these time marks.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:39.000
This one has 2, you know, whatever it is that the either just wanna watch those things or you wanna watch.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
You might wanna watch an entire conversation if it deals enough with the subject.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
But i'll be able to see that possibly yes, but it.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:57.000
It's less a problem of filtering than the problem of yeah zooming in on the relevant part.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
It's not about knowing Oh, there's these 20 videos which one has what interests me.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
It's which small part, or see it from another angle so both.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000
We have series like hours, right? We have all these Ogm and all these things, and we talk about a lot of things.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Suppose the decision is taken about what we'll do in the Meta Project are one part of the Meta project or one team of the Meta project.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:40.000
How do I know when the decisions being taken what it's about all these things that were or were not taken into account for that decision which may be dispersed around 20 videos and That's legend But this was taken

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:48.000
into account, which in this other conversation, this other conversation and we ended up with a decision way down the line.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
I'd like to be able to look at the decision? and look oh!

00:26:50.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Did they take this into account. Maybe that's another video but that's my, that's my need somebody else will have a different need.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:08.000
And what's in? How are are you looking at how to do that with that without human like I never said that?

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Well, not no, not obviously, not without human input. But I mean how to scale the ability.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000
I mean it sounds like a great, you know machine intelligence, you know.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Ai thing to be able to say, you know. Okay, rather than like having this subject that comes up.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
And you can search a transcript to find out where it comes up to like.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Build your picture of what this is if it's a meta enough issue.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
You're not gonna be able to search a single you know if it's governance, you know.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:56.000
There's going to be all these conversations about it and you need to be a lot smarter about how you analyze, which is why i'm not thinking so much about ai.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:17.000
But pete go ahead thanks I I wanted to I don't know I I under shared the screen and then it's like darn I should have kept it shared so I wanna make sure that we don't

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
get over attracted to the stock and flow. metaphor.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Kind of mark Mark, and twon is just using it to to say there's there's places where the information is flowing and and hard to capture, and then there's places where it is accumulated and been curated, and

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:51.000
things like that. Yeah, So I I just wanted to suggest another metaphor that I've been talking through is you know there's harvesting and composting and synthesizing and sense making that's so

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
that one has that metaphor again is a metaphor and it has other deficiencies.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:12.000
But we're talking those those are both pictures of the same thing and the the interesting part, I think probably, of the discussion is making sure that you can harvest, and then making sure that you can transform what you've harvested into

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:34.000
something that's more to adjustable. easier to use more more usable, you know, more compacted. more curated and things like that , and keeping the link , , I had shown you at idealoom had I it's been a long

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
time since we've seen a deal in yeah you should show it again.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:54.000
I think I should show Go ahead. I was just gonna say you know I resonate a lot more with that metaphor, you know, than than stocks and flows I mean not that It's not you know it sort of includes Stocks

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:01.000
and flows in a way. but the one thing that I don't seeing it as you laid it out right there, and I went.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:17.000
What your metaphor is is the or your analog is is the identification or the you know it's like we're keeping the link like like Mark and Johnson.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Yeah, well keeping the link, and and and identifying the that thing to say, you know it's not it's in what kind of thing it is, what subject it's on what you know all all the tags

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
that's what i'd like to introduce yes, yeah.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:56.000
But I guess I guess what in the in the harvesting, composting, synthesizing sense, making thing, what would we call?

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
You know the indexing, the the identification that sort of flat. The stop asking.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:11.000
I'll give you answers. Okay, the metaphor. So let me let me interject one thing, and then we should get to to ideal loop.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:22.000
When you when you do composting or there's there's some, or when between harvesting and composting, you take the things that aren't going to compost well and you put them in a separate

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000
bucket right we or when you're harvest when you're composting you have composting at different stages or 4 different things.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Right it's kind of like that the metaphor Yeah.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Sorting the sort of flopping in the case of composting.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
In my experience. , yeah, this is gonna this needs to break down a little bit more.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:50.000
So i'm gonna like dice, it, so the metaphor doesn't completely hold up it's it's a lot of it is just evocative, because we like to use biological metaphors, or you know,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.000
agricultural metaphors and it's easy to Say, everybody knows what harvesting everybody kind of knows what accomplishing is.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:06.000
But the you you saw me, Chi Inputs synthesizing and sense making at the end of that metaphor which is not composting at all.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
So could it, could it? We could have cooking and recipe making.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Yeah, not bad. The the except except except except cooking, is is consumes.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:26.000
The input which I don't think is necessary in this case okay, let me show quickly.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Ideal loom because I think it's relevant to what i'm trying to to build, and yet not so i'll go very quickly.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:42.000
This is ideal loom. So basically the idea was, you have a classic web forum.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
So these are messages. Forget the green to seconds. So this is a This is a thread.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:54.000
This is a fake conversation, but here's a real one Here's a real conversation with 400 messages.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:07.000
It happened. let's and and you had these small threads and people talking about this and that, and people would exactly do this.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Say, Okay, here are the themes here. so this team this is a there's cnn sorry this is a French one.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:26.000
So it's been put there so that somebody put the message there, but in other cases it was about people found and let me open.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:37.000
This people found these extracts, these passage of the text, This, this, somebody said, this goes here.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
I can take something and say, Okay, this goes here I won't do it.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
In this case this is a real conversation. I don't want to change it.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
But let me do it on the demo, because the demo gets regenerated all the time.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:56.000
See this one is in this. Id is empty right now, but I could take

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:07.000
The whole conversation. login in place that's the whole conversation and says this thing.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000
That message will remain as a seated with that idea.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
It belongs in periodic synthesis, for example.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:32.000
And now this bit of conversation, these 3 messages this bit of the thread is associated with periodic synthesis, and if I unlock and go back to periodic synthesis, I see here are the messages the thread

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:39.000
that started with this message, which i've associated with this idea and everything that is in here, and everything that is in there and here.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000
I have 3 extracts, and I can show. Okay, show me this one and show me this one and show me this one.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.000
These are the extracts of text that were associated with the idea of summarization.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.000
So this is composting. This is exactly it. This bit of text belongs here.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:08.000
And then just goes with, not reliable. And so now not reliable, has this bit of text and this bit of of the thread.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
So this was a way this was built on a web forum.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
It can read the list. serve like a email conversation or

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Because when this was built, emailed was still widely used, and that was before slack.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Facebook was there, but Facebook as we know doesn't allow export reliably.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:42.000
We have a whole Facebook export in porter written. But it's now obsolete because they changed their Api because they don't want people to get stuff out of Facebook really.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:55.000
But the whole idea that people have a conversation somewhere, and then you try to extract a structure out of it, and any of the extracts can be in many places.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:09.000
I can say this also belongs here, and I think this one doesn't it's been added here, but it's possible this didn't update at once, so that's a bug but the the notion that

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
things can exist in many places. there's a many too many relationship between ideas and the text.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
That expresses the idea. So you can ask yourself, Okay, what was said about this?

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Look at the conversation. So this is the flow, and this structure is the stuck.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
And then I can look okay. What are the great themes in here?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000
And okay, I'm interested in this one and I can jump to Okay, what was said about this?

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:39.000
So imagine. Okay, there's stuff in chat which I should take

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
You got the basic idea of ideal room it's one instantiation.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000
It's a certain, as I said it's adapted to only one or a few modality.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.000
I can also take ourss feeds and other stuff. But now we need to think beyond that, because this is not where things are happening right.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
We have conversations in so many Media and Pete, You have something to ask.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
I I do if it won't interrupt your train no, go ahead, go ahead.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:15.000
It it doesn't move forward to the future you're talking about, but it I wanna make sure not to lose it in the thread.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:30.000
So idealism. you were essentially enabling the ability to do dialogue mapping, I think, Conklin's dialogue mapping, and I wonder if you ever thought about it a view taking taking

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:37.000
the rearrangement that, or they are composing that people had done, and turn it into visualized dialogue.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Mount it's I haven't spent a lot of energy on that.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:38:02.000
But yes, you have at least divergent diagram of the terms and each of them maps back, not ideally because but it maps back to the i'm not super familiar with how dialogue

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
mapping looks or No, this is not. This is not the dialogue.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Mapping look. it's it's another look but I could have made this: I didn't identify like he r identified this as a question.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
This is an answer. This is, or sorry. This is an answer.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
This at the beginning is a question so yeah but that's that came later up to a point.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:29.000
And Hey, this do you have a a quick way to show us what dialogue mapping looks like?

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Well, the best for that is, since craft, and I think I showed it.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:41.000
But let me look or compendium no no no well yeah sure that's that's good.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Can I get that picture about compendium Maybe there's a big version of pet picture companion was one of the good training.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Sorry to put you on the spot. Okay, let me.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:11.000
And i'm familiar. So a a related thing is it's concept mapping some little bit different.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Okay, I guess this is as good an example as we'll get yay.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
So this is, it's not a good example now I can do better than that.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Frankly, let me get sense craft here's one maybe

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:46.000
I I put one in chat but maybe it's sad to say, since craft may be this so surviving dialogue mapping tools that that is not good.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:56.000
So here we have a Can you click on the one in chat real quick,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Oh, yeah, that's a good one. Yes, Yes, Yes, so here's a question here's different answers here.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Here's this question. This answer has raises a new question so you can add questions.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000
There, and new answers to that sub question or you can say Oh, here's why this is not a good idea Con.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Just why this is a good idea pro and here's references to support the pros and cons.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000
And so this. So So one of the things that dialogue mapping is best at is wicked problems.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:48.000
So everybody can see, and kind of differentiate the different things I in in the You can imagine this conversation in you know, in a school board public meeting, where everybody is just shouting and everybody's got their own thing that they're talking

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
about. but if you, if you map it like this then you can say hey, look!

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000
You're talking about this piece the thing that we need to to figure out is the answers to this question.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
So that's what what you would use a dialogue map for Ram.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Yeah, that that in human terms one good thing about projecting a dialogue map, as a conversation happens, is it gets people instead of talking, you know, instead of shouting at you, I can divert it. it creates a limited.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Object. So I can say this is what I disagree with and then I'm pointing at the board not as you, and it does change the dynamic. but it was kind of a stock.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000
It's a it's absolutely a stock it it but it does require a skilled dialogue Mapper to do the real-time map.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:44.000
As people are speaking, they've tried a synchronous and it didn't work nearly as well, and the question is, how can we make it work as synchronous?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Really because the way this synchronous is everybody, either.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Well, basically they let people create the map. And then basically, you had people who did not understand the methodology as well create havoc, or you had a lot of side issues that would make the thing blow out of proportion and you had the

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:13.000
usual Wendy called it the bird's neck nest instead of the ball of darn that's cool, but it's eligible.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Michael, you had a question. Oh, it it It was just about in ideal loom.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000
How the recurrence of a term that falls.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000
You know the way the way these things are nested.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Terms are nested. if a nested term shows up in other under other headings, is there is there linkage there?

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Or no. right now the ideal loom table of ideas, as we call it, is not is a tree.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:05.000
It's not a graph, so every known exist only in one place in the treat.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:16.000
However, as I said it's possible to take those extracts and put them in many places, which is another way to achieve the same multi location.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000
But ideally I would have wanted the ideal to the left, right thing to be a graph.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:39.000
But there's they didn't go to and was overruled at the beginning. so mark and 2011 or 12 min we have left with you So what's the difference between ideal loom or dialog mapping and

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:52.000
the thing that you're thinking of the thatload mapping is one case of stock, And, by the way, ideal loom is not restricted to dialogue mapping that was a bit of a also a

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:00.000
parenthesis which I think is important but we didn't need to get into, because the whole the point of ideal loom was not that like mapping?

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:15.000
It was idea classification and in the way there's many different methodologies to create a stock that look Mapping is one way of doing stocks.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:24.000
It's not the only way and I absolutely I think it's important to be analytical about things and dialogue Mapping is one way to be analytical.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
There's many ways to be analytical and there's many ways to be synthetic, and that's the 2, and we need both.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:46.000
What's important, however, is that we have all these conversation, all these flows that nobody will reread, or very few people will read, and we want to be able to create synthetic use synthetic curated views that are connected

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:54.000
to this, and so forget Id loom, which is one tool if we think Federation.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:09.000
If we think if we think collective what we want is we want to be able to point to a part of a piece of conversation, and that's Urls up to a point.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000
But we need to be a bit standard about making sure that it's easy to create.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:27.000
You are a representation of the text on the web with the Url that can allow to pinpoint subsets and all that. mechanics has been done with web annotations. So that's not difficult.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:45.000
But we have to make sure we have that part we have the identification of idea in the various synthesis tools, and what we need is a many to many connection like, if i'm doing this stuff making an ideal loom and

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
somebody else is doing an insense craft, and somebody else is doing it in calo or in Kumu, or in whatever.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:46:06.000
What I want is to be able to take my little i'm talking about this bit of the conversation Have the same Url, but also had it in a way that I can go back to the conversation view and know Oh, this bit of the conversation has

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:23.000
been annotated by Macout one, and ideal Loom and by in massive wiki and by Michael in Kumu, and by Stacey and Callo, or whatever right or in the factor it Shouldn't matter so we

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:38.000
need. I kind of many too many a way federated distributed centralized up to a point. I don't care, but we need a way to say this bit of the conversation has shown up in this aggregation tool and

00:46:38.000 --> 00:47:00.000
It's a many, too many because many people may be sense making on that conversation, And there has to be a federated thing where we can ask, Okay, where has this been sense made composted where and what are all the

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000
composers to use, and can we make them talk that's an ext That's the hyper knowledge plan.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Can we connect these things? But I think the first step, which is in a way easier and a way harder.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Well, not harder but it's it's it's a separate step.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:34.000
It's the bits of conversation make sure they have their addressable, and say this of conversation are in relationship with ideas represented in stockmaking apps, and the next step is making sure.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Oh, how you identified his idea. in this stuck making a house to correspond to the idea, and that's not making happen. That's the other That's the next step.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:58.000
But before that we can just do bit of conversation to idea and stop making app and that's already something that can be useful for people looking at a conversation, and want to know what's being done with that and so that's what

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:13.000
I'm saying, we need we should think hard about a very simple, you know I concepts have an identifier, and every tool will have their own light in the fires, and that's fine and bits of conversations have an

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:20.000
identifier, and we want to make the connection and make the different tools be aware of the connection.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:33.000
So we can have like bidirectional next i'd like to make a connection to do you go delete hera in fellowship of the link.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:45.000
So he was talking about something similar conceptually, at least, where content repositories could be queried to say, hey!

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000
What do you have about this link? Or he? He also said, What do you have about this concept?

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000
And then factor a massive wiki or catalyst or whatever idealism could say.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Here's you know here the conversations I have on my server that reference that.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:08.000
So you could do you know it's it's like service discovery, basically for is that the overweight?

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Hello, I'm trying to remember names I I actually don't know anything about them.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:25.000
I I haven't been to any of the scholarship meetings. but you posted a a cool little, you know. that's a you that's somebody else.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Yeah over took 2. That, you know, does he? Benjamin is the overweight guy.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:59.000
So deacon no Diego, i'm not sure I know then, i'll have to have a look bye bye start his his handle, and thought God that's a aggressive die God la

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Kind of reminds me in an odd way, Boost Sterling is playing around with Dolly, the Ai.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Image generator, and he was trying to get it to make a particular demon.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000
God thing, and it's so he was using the the description of the demon God thing you know, muscular man with blah blah blah, and he didn't get any good results.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000
But then he put 0 or one, and the name like concat.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
I pretended to the name of the the demon God, and he got some really good ones, and it was.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:45.000
It was not like. so somehow, Dolly is taking that number and taking off the word, or something like that, and doing something interesting with them, which, now that I've said that I also have to mention somebody else has had there was this great tweet

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:53.000
thread about. hey? look! the ai has an internal language about what and and I've discovered the internal language. How so?

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:59.000
You can type these nonsense words at I think it might have been Dolly. i'm not sure which one, and it would.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000
It would recapitulate images that you wouldn't have thought of So it's like this is the internal language.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.000
So somebody else. It was a it's a fun thread somebody else debunk that.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000
And he said, Yeah, that's not what's happening here's what's really happening.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000
So now to find those links and post them to fluttle, I guess.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:23.000
But okay, Tiger de la hada thank you i'll have a look.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:32.000
So yeah, this is We should also hook up with a fellowship of the link, a little bit more tightly.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.000
That's something that jerry's kind of been involved in and I haven't been to any of the meetings.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:47.000
But we're talking about similar things. how I see Flansian is in that conversation

00:51:47.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Really cool really cool my and fun Well, it's it's they just started launching the the Id But I think let's talk about the the requirements and make this into I think I I feel like

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:14.000
I feel like we could work on our metaphors a little bit more, too, to to understand it better.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:22.000
I I I kinda know what we're talking about and I kind of don't, and I didn't don't have a good mental label for what we're talking about.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Okay, what one component that that really strikes me as we're really talking about a lot of metadata on the a single statement link, you know.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Comment, segment of A. of a conversation that says, You know that that has This is , This is where it appears.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:17.000
This is how central it is, and you know I mean that that really the annotation, you know, to go go back to I mean the library metaphor.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:32.000
We've used before it's like sort of backlinking all the things that anybody highlighted and used anywhere, you know. any time this was quoted anywhere else. , That's Why, it has to be , , from

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:39.000
the from the sentence from the book to the the places that was quoted.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:44.000
Yeah, totally. and that's why offline notation.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:52.000
It cannot be in line. I I would say, instead of offline, I would call that out of bound.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000
I I think offline is a bit of an official term now.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:03.000
By people who are writing those systems yeah didn't realize that How?

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:12.000
How is so? this is related. to hyper knowledge too of course of course it's a it's a small bit of it, but it's related.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:19.000
So , so we don't have to implement hyper knowledge to implement whatever we're talking about.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:30.000
That's the point it's like i'm trying to find out the small bits and frankly there's a whole thing about going from transcript doing offline annotation transcript that's hugely important

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:40.000
that's hugely useful on its own and it's like if I can make that not part of the hyper Knowledge Project. I.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:48.000
It makes my life easier and wendy and I are doing projects where what we haven't been doing offline.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Well, actually, we're doing we're doing the stuff that would deliver offline.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:00.000
So she's. she's doing pull quotes and things like that she's also when the she's also adding additional materials.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:10.000
But we don't have that stitch together. we're not doing an offline version of the transcript to statute that it's it's disconnected right now, so we will i'll wrap that in with

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:36.000
wendy we'll do more of that and we've actually got real use cases , bye bye, bye, oops, Jonathan, we miss you I don't know if you can hear us

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:43.000
You know, as as you guys were just talking i'm sorry this this this is sort of continuation of of my phones.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Combo pet The idea that where we really we're talking about a scheme for every piece of information that allows for you know places this piece of information that superior people who have piece of information people who have

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:21.000
quoted that, you know, did it like so? the the the the number of fields, the number of things that would be filled into the fields of

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:31.000
You know the it I think, therefore I am, You know, like how many times has that been quoted in one?

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:49.000
In what context, how many different things has that been I mean it's like? No, it's it's metadata that what is in almost every case much greater than you know is really what we're looking for

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:56.000
Yeah, I I wish you could have. I wish we could have asked Marcus one about

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:10.000
Xanadu, so ted nelson's Ted Nelson envisioned you know a system where everything was linked together, and and, you know, you could trace back references and things like that which

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:31.000
which wasn't eric brangle showing I I don't know if it was in flotilla, but he was he was zigzag zigzag is related right

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:41.000
awesome. It also reminds me in a weird way.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Yesterday I was reading about about the Mandela effect

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.000
I can still mandela somebody it's it's funny.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Somebody went through here's a bunch of examples of the menela effect with, I don't know star trek or Star Wars, or something like that, and they they didn't say what the mandela effect was and

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:12.000
i'm like what's that the mandela effect is a culturally held memory.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:17.000
That's incorrect so it's named after Nelson Mandel.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Everybody thought he died in prison in the in the eighties but he didn't

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Everybody thinks that the flint stones has 2 teas in the name everybody or not everybody, you know.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Many people remember that like affirmative action like of course you know. and then it's not the right thing.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:57.000
So that's there's like there's cases I I wonder maybe I can

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Feel like there's this weird thing with my browser history that it's not quite doing what I thought it would be doing.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.000
But anyway, you know, of course, curious storage has a tail.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Oops. What do you mean, he doesn't have a town No, this is the wrong way to do this Of course it's jiffy.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:32.000
It's not jeff of course it's t o and not to un so

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:40.000
, So there's a weird thing where the the reference that you have might be it to a thing that's false.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000
And then you have to have a reference to the true thing.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:54.000
And then maybe right references about why you believe that, or how many people believe that, or or whatever

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Wow, I types exact that I didn't type fantastic

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:18.000
It's a good observation my call it's a lot of the the metadata would much out, you know.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Same thing happens when I look up, quotes one of the things I like to do is you know.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Plans are useless, but planning is, you know, imperative, or

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:39.000
The the best is the enemy of the good and you'll find, you know, 3 different people there's 20 or 30 different people.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
It's attributed to their 3 or 3 2 or 3 people.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
It's you can affirmatively, attribute to them.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
But they said a different way, and you know yeah they got it in different languages, you know.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Here's the translation that got popular yeah yeah and and you know the related, you know, relationship to 80 20 rule, you know, or and you know different.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Yeah. different variations. and how often it appears like with or is used in opposition to excellent Yeah.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Thing to think about is the Google text actually can answer those kinds of questions.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Not that they provided an interface to it but yeah you know Google's Ai.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Actually understands a lot of that stuff

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:47.000
In in ways that humans probably don't understand how it understands

01:01:47.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Yeah, I was trying to dig deep on reasons

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:28.000
This shows where my head's at and you'll understand why but possible grounds for legal challenges to the Jerry mandering of States in order to like you know classically North and South Dakota or 2 State I mean There

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:43.000
are other reasons. But one of the main reasons that got through statehood was ratified was because the Republicans we're the good guys at that point.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:51.000
But but but the Republicans were like, if we have 2 States We're gonna carry these 2 States, and we'll have 4 Senators instead of 2.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Of course you know an electoral votes and and so that bit of state, Jerry mandering which conceivably could be challenged in court the way a gerrymander could be challenged in

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:26.000
court. Anyway, I was trying to ask Google about this and and try to find, you know, other other examples of of statehood being connected, you know, just putting a bunch of words in, and it was pretty good.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:33.000
I was, I was surprised by how much like weird small stuff I was able to raise in that area.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Reminds me of my it's funny I I wanna say favorite, but I guess it's least favorite example of jeremandering.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:52.000
This is where Hudson Yards. a fancy thing. in Manhattan, is a distressed urban area, because it's connected up to Harlem.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
It's like Oh, yeah, this is definitely part of our own no worries.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:04.000
That's that's the right way. to Do that yeah and Central Park is definitely a distressed area.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Yes, exactly. it's it's the least objectionable connection you know.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Yeah, interesting. Now they're they're you know not a lot of income there, it's true,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:35.000
It it. I wonder if we'll maybe kind of wrap because it's been an hour and my head is certainly fall after full on
