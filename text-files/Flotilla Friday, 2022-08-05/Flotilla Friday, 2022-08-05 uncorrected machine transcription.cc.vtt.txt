WEBVTT

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so till a Friday, August, Fifth, 2022.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Vincent was thinking we could go back through our our notes and kind of pull out needs and requests and solutions and things like that.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So. I think a happens to be I have upsetting up because we might need that.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I don't think I have a vault actually even for flotilla.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So I think where the notes are is

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
They get logged into foot over here

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Decide get home.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Okay.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So this is where I think we've got notes so all of those right Damn yup!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.000
That's it. So then I should have this on my computer someplace.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So let me log in There.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Make sure it's up to today

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:42.000
All kinds of cool stuff.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So, my just to kind of look and see what we got what i'm thinking is to concatenate all the all the meeting notes and you could run a group to do that.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Yeah, and then pull it up and just kind of scroll through it and go like, Okay, what have we got?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Could you add a header at the top of each one, so you could see the the Oh, they all have that, and my notes are ready

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The transcript and the chat hello let's Let's see those out for now.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Yeah, we could leave this out so see and actually they're text files, anyway.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So that's just a list of

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So i'm gonna

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So i'm gonna

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I'm gonna do this a turkey way because michelle scripting isn't great and this these have spaces.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The file names have spaces that are going to do a weird way.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Okay.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Okay. So now fire up, Taikora

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
That pour on my m One has this an annoying thing where it crashes a lot.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I don't lose stuff, but I I can't leave it lying around in the background, and it sooner later crashes which is fine to

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Okay.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So this is what it looks like these are that's Mx.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Actually. Yeah. So we have a few. These, These great things are like chats.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And the the next thing from cool actually.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:11.000
So that one there was a zoom chat. Yeah, this one got cleaned up by either me or at least tool.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Oh, nice!

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:32.000
This is This is probably a belly's tool here yeah Okay, sure, and probably with a little bit of cleanup afterwards.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So the good news is we have notes I don't know kind of the bad news is they're kind of all kinds of weird, all kinds of weird formats.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Our Our note taking, you know, has been I? I do it once in a while.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Probably a lot of it to kind of meet pushing for notes we don't do it a lot also.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
But then we don't have a a decent I guess this is pretty common.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I'll use this so this is this size is a new file, and then this size is like the top level things in the in the notes.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So i'm pretty consistent about using topics so we could find all the topic things and find stuff in here.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So I'm. almost 13 there's some report on projects.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I think we have a lot of like tools. Yeah, like San Francisco

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Yep it would be easy to i'm gonna use a unix term here.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Grab graph means search So graph works line by line it would be really easy to find all the all the bullet points something really easy to do, and so some of them would be single single words, or something you know single things like this some

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:17.000
of them would be kind of a note thing some of them wouldn't be noise, but that would be kinda interesting Just pull out all the bullets.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I like that some. So something else that occurs to me.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Not for this meeting, but as a bookmark to ourselves for the future.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000
It would be really cool there's there's some decent structure here is not not well.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:50.000
There's some decent structure in here and what is what occurs to me is that if you took this Markdown and turned it into Json

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:59.000
There's a a tool called Jq. where you can do I think the queue stands for query, and J.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Stands for Jason in a structure in a in a Json document.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
You can do things like. Give me all of the the bullets, or give me all the headers.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:25.000
If if the markdown to Jason deserves like some some of the the metadata of what each of these lines was, you could use J.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Query Jq. to pull out I I can pull out the

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I can pull out the bullets just with grap. but

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And but that is a simple text matching thing it doesn't really understand the structure.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.000
The mark down to Json to Jq. could actually understand some of the structure of the pages.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Then, you know, pull out all the second level headers although I can do that too, You know that's a Let's do that first.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I like that. there's another funny thing I always spell grap with e grap for extended group.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:12.000
But you don't need to anymore. but I do so if you do.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Okay, that's all the second level headers

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Oh, above from from this whole the all of the concatenated

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:54.000
You could actually do a thing where

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000
That's first and second level, so you can see what pages and then the headings.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So that's pretty cool yeah let me save that to something on that h one h 2

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And then let me

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Yeah shoot I got. I got all the headings. I wasn't quite careful enough what the went matching.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
But maybe that's okay.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Yeah, that's maybe even better so let me change these 2

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:15.000
So now that's like an outline

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
This is a non-duplicated outline, right?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
So topics you can search how many times we had something.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Yeah, if if I pulled this up I don't think I pull this up, and i'm sitting instead.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000
This turns into like a or cloud. No, although you could do you could do that, too.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
You could make it so that you can collapse.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Clouds, things that open

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Okay, so kinda got a syntax, or I I didn't do my well with a little bit more work. I could make it.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So it doesn't have these bullets but you can still see what's going on so

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
We could try pulling out all the topics sections or do the same thing.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But I just what I just just did was headers so let's do the same thing for bullets.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And I think i'll end up being top level bullets could you could you send that All note H* to me somehow.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:14:13.000
What i'll do is

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I'd presume it's okay if they're mark down files

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:46.000
So i'll i'll do all notes and all that's h one h 2 although actually i'm gonna rename this one because it's Peters

00:14:46.000 --> 00:15:02.000
In in related news. I met with Jonathan, and we decided to just blurge and spend $7 a month on a markdown plugin for Bubble that Io.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:16.000
So now, catalyst can display Markdown yeah, before when I was importing rich texts, mark down from air table like an air table.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:29.000
You can add links and headers within a cell. If I, When I was syncing that there was no way to actually display it, it would just show up as like, you know, the raw like, with the half tags and stuff, and

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000
so that was the easiest solution could figure out.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:45.000
That's cool I I I wonder if

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I I bet it wouldn't be too hard to write one of those.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:59.000
So we should. We should take all our chainsaw stuff and make make a little business of

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
No code plugins and Api stuff. I I agree.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:14.000
This one is $70 one time and $7 a month that's a lot, I think, and it's the only one on the market has like 2.5 star ratings.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I think you could definitely make a better one. Yeah.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:29.000
For less money, too, because like that's kind of Yeah that's like one of the more expensive plugins that like I would have bought it if it was like box like a year ago.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
So. So that's the thing for our our needs or something right needs project.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Yeah, i'll add that as a project I like this cool all the all the bullets.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Oh, wow! so right now it's in chronological order!

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
But I could I could sort it and be deep it that's probably a worthwhile thing right?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I think it's kind of interesting to see how many instances of something right like if if thing is said 20 times versus 2 times, I feel like that's helpful information for us to like yeah

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:34.000
So not saying don't deny it but saying we should all so figure out a way of potentially, leaving it duplicated to see the number of times.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Something was mentioned.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:52.000
I the if we did some

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Yeah, there you go. If if we did some cleanup we'd get better counts.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:09.000
But this this number here is account of how many times this happened. So there's 4, and faster right up there.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Man chosen. Michael's flying highs today miro kind of makes it cool.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Kind of makes it Kika lab. So then the rest of these are all ones.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:41.000
But if we if we did a little bit more like maybe we'd want to, we need a flotilla website is like, yeah, or you see that 4 times

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:51.000
So let me Let me i'll publish this one actually after I put the numbers at the end of the lines. So hang on.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Let me do that real quick and then these can st bullets It'd be interesting to see the one thing about I mean It's it's for sure useful and and interesting to see what gets mentioned. a lot.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000
But I wonder about losing the

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:26.000
The access to the sequence, I mean, and ideally the time stamp of when things come up.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Yeah. This is what this this meeting, this meeting was mostly about.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:45.000
X, you know but I I I could do I could do some more fancy stuff, and you know, and and tag each line with what?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
What meeting, You know what what file it was in, or something like that.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And now, and that contains also the date, so you could do some cool stuff where you could grab everything, and then clustered into when you know when it was let me.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:30.000
I I grabbed the the way, I grabbed bullets there's some dashes and some stars, and and let me change these all the dashes and with them all the left

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000
And then this will be a better, better, dude thing. What are your thoughts, Stacy?

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Is it possible to see this in a venue diagram There's yeah the there there are lots of items right now, and there aren't many clusters, if that makes sense So right now there's like 6

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000
150 different different things. So if you had 650 different balls, you could kind of see that.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:22.000
And then you did that. I think it would be really useful.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
The And do you mean having things inside the circles?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Or just yes, but because then you then, what I think would be useful is seeing the things that were outside.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Yeah I don't like the the notes don't support that we'll have a mention of Kiko lab, but then we'll have a mention of other things and you can't there there isn't a good way to

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:57.000
tie the No, I don't mean to mention of Kiko lab I mean a mention of a knee.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:08.000
He go there so we don't have we have needs But you you can't see from this data very well that it's a kick lab need, or a factor need or something like that.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:20.000
So and I think that would require that would require putting this into a a database, and then doing what like Wendy Maclean did for the Lionsburg Zoom, going to the message and Then tagging it

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
with certain groups, And then you could do that vend diagram like clustering.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Yeah, you could totally do that. Thanks. and and that's a lot of work, which is, Yeah,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Hey, you're like a wizard with this yeah Been doing a long time it would be cool to like it'd be cool to do more of this like stripping out the quotes and stuff like that and we could get it clustered. better but i'll i'll leave this

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:35.000
for Now this is getting pretty good. it's Okay, so let me put the numbers on the back again.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:24:05.000
And

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:30.000
This is well air table just twice. So a next. a good next thing to do would be to pick out some of these like kick.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:40.000
11, and then find them in. like Brian mentioned. Some people have, or find mentions of flotilla.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Transcript. No, even just in like just just clustering these because because I did a simple, a simple, unique function.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Yeah, I did look for all the flotilla things and then put them all together.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
It's just everywhere, it says flotilla website exactly it it bubbled up together.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:25.000
But bet effect, my terminal if we took

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:42.000
So if we look for all the flotilla mentions in the bullets, So this is all of them that we get, and that's probably like 50 of them.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Some of them are the titles I didn't do a good job taking out the titles

00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Or same thing with like Kicklow. That would be interesting

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Or factor.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Factory that's pretty good

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Wendy, Alfred, and Lexie Mancer could do a little bit more with us.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Lexie, manager works best on like Mike.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Full sentences and stuff like that. but it it it it might be able to do things like it understands parts of speech and and and English.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:11.000
The way English is structured so it can tell where there's nouns on where there's verbs and stuff like that, so you might be able to tell it to find all the nouns in here so

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
that wouldn't like I think it would just try to ignore stuff like this, because there's no language there.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:29.000
But it could find you know this as a noun, and it might find something like that as a now

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:37.000
We could do the parts. Press speech is a generic thing too, you Can there's tools that do that Does it have to be like some answer.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Oh, another good one would be a air table

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:05.000
So then that's just bullets with their table in it If we search all nodes, and i'll clear the screen

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:15.000
We don't. we don't have air table much in the notes really I I feel slighted.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:24.000
I'm kidding how about you

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Yeah. Okay, Can you do the word project project or projects?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Yeah. in the bullets, or in the full text the text or wait Let's try text, Yeah.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:17.000
For 55 good That's interesting and then so that's the the thing to do now is to go back to this text, and just search down for a project right

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Yeah, because then you can go. You could pretty quickly go through this and find

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:39.000
See if you wanna grab these and into something right

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Yeah, Another good one might be Task.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Scroll back up to the top

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Yup. There you go 2110 15 that's the project.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:18.000
I I feel like times when tasks is mentioned It's gonna be a project about creating a task .

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:31.000
That was a good one. Yeah, yeah you're good good call you're totally right.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:41.000
But there's probably some other words that would like to do, or

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000
That would probably get closer if we did. Yeah, to do this and get it.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.000
If if we had been hashtagging, Hashtag here knows we could find things like to do.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Is How about about later list of

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Or just list.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Yeah, actually, just the just the topic. sections would be pretty good to

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Does that not working? Oh, there it is!

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:28.000
So there's not many times I use topics hmm i'm surprised by that.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000
I it was something I maybe agenda's got more I used to use.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Hey, C is agenda, and I switched the topics

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:51.000
So there's like 5 or 6 hits on agenda

00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:02.000
I think a lot of the a lot of times i'll put stuff in the agenda items, and they're not necessarily other people's.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:14.000
This one is pretty good

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:22.000
I So then said you should play around with some of these files and see what you see.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Okay, Is there one where it's just the whole thing all those?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Yeah, thanks. I haven't opened that one yet yeah i'll definitely play around with this. This is what I've just started doing with

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:56.000
The all notes headers is I pasted it here, and then I went through, and I started. so are kind of the main types that I started to see.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:10.000
So commitments, updates, experiments, ideas, resources, people, tools, projects, open loops, question solutions, topics, needs.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:29.000
And then these are So then I was kind of going through like filter, where notes contains project or filter where the notes contains, like, you know.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Task. although yeah, like I was when I was doing this, I was like, Oh, wait a minute. it's gonna come up with test lists and not the actual instances of tasks.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:47.000
This is just the header. So also but it would be cool to yeah play around with importing.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Maybe the whole notes file in here and do some filtering line is filterable.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Then you can kind of yeah, do you wanna try that real quick now or sure.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
I mean the only thing I would wanted to figure out how to do is if I could like, Michael was saying.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
We? wanna If we're doing a lot of stuff to these we wanna be able to see what meeting it came from.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
So I would What I would want is a line item just like this for every like.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Well. but then, next to it would be a like a date, and so that way, if this one was fluttered.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Friday here. all the all the things from that date would be there.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:44.000
That would be the ideal format to be able to to like change the sort, and filtering and and still kind of preserve where the stuff came from.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Then you could do things like, Look at display it at some point, you know, as as trends like Hmm!

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
We totally used to talk about this and we don't talk about this anymore.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:06.000
And then there's a big uptick in talking about x that's That's probably about 20 min of python.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:19.000
I i'll do them 20 min, of type blog is that you said so I I can make that so i'll make a like a Csv.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Or maybe a Tsv

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Okay, cool. Yeah, that would be awesome if yeah, if you did that, Pete, I would definitely go through it and and add some tags and stuff before the next meeting.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:43.000
So the is it okay to do the full text one, I think the full text would work.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Would you be able to the if it was a header?

00:36:47.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Or yes, it yeah, I The easy thing to do is just leave it the way it is, and then, if it starts off with you know one hash or 2 hashes, those are different headers or a dantra star at the front his

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:16.000
bullets. to be a little bit fancier and I probably I This this is doable, but I won't do it right right away.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:34.000
You could actually It's this is actually a pretty cool utility, though you could go through each line and and and then in the output, Csv you could have this is an H.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
One h 2 h 3, you know, or a bullet level, one bullet level to a bullet level 3.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:51.000
So you could actually add that as metadata you can do that usually in Eric table, though with just a a bunch of it's like if hashtag it's header one if it's 2

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
hashtags

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:04.000
The

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
The.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:18.000
The the tricky part of that is is kind of the corner cases Sometimes we'll have hashtags, you know, in a bullet, or something like that, and it's not a header even though it has a an

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:30.000
octo thorp in it. have to be the like yeah, we could do like search.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Yeah, an air table. They do like left and right so you can isolate the first 2 or great characters, and then do a search within that There's also rejects

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:52.000
It. wouldn't be that hard to do that it would be kind of it would be easier to do that kind of stuff in the python script.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:09.000
It's just a little bit more work. Yeah, and that would be a good next next thing if we want to cool good topic, Vincent: thanks to yeah, that was that was pretty cool.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:18.000
See how that happening, Pete.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
I'm kind of good well i'm kind of feeling lazy today.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
So now that we're about 10 10 o'clock i'm like yeah

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:40.000
I'll i'll take us back to our our off topic from before I was looking around for other ai art generators, and stumbled on Wambo have you tried one though, I think that's the one I put in

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:46.000
chat is Was it this chat another chat today?

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Maybe was actually really good. it's cool works Well, it also looks much less like it.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Looks much I don't know, for for me I I kind of the idea that it I see less artifact of other things.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:25.000
And it really seems like a I like I was just trying it's line elephant and elephant flying, and you know, in etching style or steam clock. you know just different things, and no there's no I don't look

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:33.000
in anything, then say, Oh, I see this could be could share some of these things.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Yes, always bum that you can't drop images in the zoom chat you can.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:58.000
You could attach. Thanks, I don't think it's Dragon drop, but you can click through it all attach

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:22.000
I've got a whole bunch of almost stuff some place on my computer

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Hmm, hmm.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:53.000
So this looks like it might let me

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Looks like it does drag and drop.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:18.000
But then we have to open up let's say

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:35.000
It it's just interesting that it's is here's one of mine

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:45.000
That one's pretty cool. So it knows what a trading card looks like, yeah, the file name.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Yeah.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:05.000
And dream is, I guess it's the the name of the app and Wambo is oh, Okay,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Here's a good one. What was your what was your splendid like

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
The the normal ones are are definitely more they're they're art see looking

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000
The thing about Dolly is that you can get you could get things kind of like are small.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
I don't know there's a a certain like to one, but stuff like like there's a certain look to to mid journey.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Stuff. but Dolly can look like anything kind of

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Yeah, Yeah, it's also really good at mashups you know the the mix of 2 things did you give any with your prompts.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.000
You didn't offer any style I I do a fair amount of style.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Yeah, I mean like stone closet on you know clearly wasn't old engraving.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
But what? what? the so the the theamma ones?

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.000
They, you know the one ones have a bunch of preset styles you know. there's 20 styles or something like that.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
So that was one particular style. I don't know what what it was.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:50.000
But then dali died doesn't have built-in styles, but it has, it knows a lot of style and it can do kind of weird mixes. You know mashups to the styles

00:44:50.000 --> 00:45:12.000
meshes mesh it ups of styles and mashups of of subjects

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
I'm also down to i'm feeling a little busy as well.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:26.000
So down to end early. But I did have one quick thing I wanted to share today before we end

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Not sure if now, it's our time but let's see we find the tab.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Okay. So This is a feature that I had come up with and implemented a while ago.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
But it was never possible to actually see the output of it.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:57.000
So this is the lines we've met a project group on capabilities. And right now i'm in the events Tab.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:04.000
And so I added this filter here to see basically right now it's showing kind of all the events.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:23.000
But you can see the past ones or you can see future ones only and then there's a new one here for ideas, and so you can submit an event.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:30.000
And then you could close. We do. Okay, you can submit event and then make an event idea.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:45.000
And so this event idea means that when you set a date it's just a date range in which the event should happen, and then a minimum number of attendees And so basically I propose an event idea for a video reporting process

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:52.000
session to go through the process line or use for archiving, processing video recordings and zoom, chat files.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.000
And then I put 3 as the minimum threshold for like if 3 people are interested in it.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Then let's schedule it and so this has its own page says it's like an event idea.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:12.000
And then within the group, people can select that they are interested in it.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:19.000
And then I was cons Yeah, so right now it's a 0 to 3 people that you said I can express interest in my own meeting.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
So then it says i'm interested in it says one out of 3

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
I was thinking of leaving the rest like after it gets to 3.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000
I was thinking of sending a notification to the person who created it.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:37.000
But then otherwise leaving it up to that person to do whatever they want.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:45.000
So like, Hey, here's the list of emails all the people that said they were interested like, create a calendar, or send out a one is good or right?

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Have some process of here here, maybe some recommended tools to schedule.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Yeah. that's the that idea feature like actually Oh, yeah, at all out of state, where I feel like it actually might be able to be used.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:09.000
It's brilliant good one thanks

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:25.000
And i'm interested in that meeting too and i'm I'm, You know i'm i'm trying to think like, Do you have the the link I guess you use emails and you can use crap chip whatever let's

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000
see like it would also be nice to Yeah, Exactly.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Yeah, what's that we would just crap It is is like is the the latest scheduling tool that we're using?

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Oh, okay, and it's open source Oh, interesting okay

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Yeah. every time it was mentioned in the chat the transcripts, I said, crap fit

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.000
I got a list of these tools in place, so we also use.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:17.000
We use when to meet, but then we switch to ground set and then I I actually, I think I picked up crabs it from spirit.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:24.000
But then he's off to another thing now I think I started making a list.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Now I think about. I think i'd have a list started of these, but none or an air table, maybe, or something.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Is an air table

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Yeah, that's the really smart idea thanks yeah I i'm I'd like to propose it to be used at a future Linesburg meeting.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:00.000
So if people like, I know it happens a lot where people are like, you know, I really any like Stacy in this meeting mentioned like, I think we should have a meeting about this other red topic.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Or so to be able to actually put that down and then let other people say like, Oh, yeah, i'm interested in that like, yeah, i'm hoping that can actually catalyze right get some get some things rolling that otherwise wouldn't

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:20.000
happen

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000
I clicked, interested on your video recording process session.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Sweet the between doesn't quite work between let's see it says

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Maybe you didn't set up the date or maybe it's just playing a weird

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Oh, yeah, it says proposed between Friday, August fifth and one.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Pm: So I need to. Yeah, need to make that show the

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:15.000
The second date. Yeah, Yeah, that's that's a shortcut only if only if the start and the end they are the same thing.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:24.000
It won't say, between Friday august the 2022 at one and Friday, August

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Sweet. I really like it. I'm. thinking to add the person who proposed it as well.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Yeah, And yeah, you definitely should do that, although in in the description of that one it says, Vincent at the end, is that I added that because I realized there was no way for me to on that card show that it was me who

00:51:49.000 --> 00:52:04.000
proposed it. I mean you'd probably open ups some possibilities, both good and bad.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Within an image. but it does seem like you at least would want the option to let people know

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:18.000
That's probably better going to be a responsibility here's my list of tools.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.000
So far.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:31.000
I don't know why. I don't know I don't know how I didn't get farther than this.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:47.000
I I don't know I guess I got far enough to write this down, and and it's a pretty good Let me share this that will be

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Feel feel free to steal everything and make it better, or something like that.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:58.000
I will. I will add, if I make it better, I will do it in here, so you you can bet it from that.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Is editor good enough, or should I give you a creator or since it's only this table a creator works cause that way.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:25.000
I can add other fields

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Awesome.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Too many ads. Yes, that was I, you know. Doodle was okay for a long time.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000
You know the the frustrating thing is I really early days.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:53.000
I I've social media and stuff. I I had written one a scheduling poll tool, and

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000
It was as good as Doodle at the time.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000
And then I I lost it. I lost the source code, or something like that.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000
So every time I looked at doodle it's like dang I could have had that.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000
But I ended up using dual instead. but then finally it got so bad that I actually tweeted about it.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:24.000
It's like doodle seriously you know like I have to wade through all these crappy ads, it's like no way man i'm out of here.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:32.000
So some of the open source ones, if spirit was was likely from a date, apparently.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:38.000
But it's it's more complex than like crap crap fit is like when the meeting they're both easy.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:49.000
But anyway, one of these open source ones I i've been thinking Cs could run one of them was one of them.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:56.000
So that would be fun. Yeah, the calendar one i'm gonna add, is actually quite good.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Is it? Do you have to be a countly person or Yeah, But you don't have to be a county person to participate just to create it.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:16.000
So it's you click there's a browser extension, and then you can do create meeting Poll.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Nice. I don't know if you could see the pop up. Let me try re-sharing, however.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Now I yes, so it has my calendar, and then select times like this.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000
Yup, and then it says, like 1010 times selected.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000
I can also change the duration to be like an hour.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:56:00.000
I could overwrite like, you know and then basically hit next, and then it will create a, you know, 9 times on 2 days you can put a location and the name and then publish it.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.000
You can also have it schedule all those slots on your calendar, so no one else on those times.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:20.000
So yeah, there is reserve time, is cool and then i'm not actually gonna publish it, but it has a pretty nice Ui for when it publishes it, and it has a thing where you can actually send it in

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:27.000
an email and it within the email you could click the button time you want, and then it will scheduled that one.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:34.000
So it's pretty cool sweet

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:42.000
I I have challengedly and never use just by the bullet and do it is that that that looks really convenient.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Add the browser extension. Yeah.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Good meeting folks. How I done was. Was it fun, Pete?

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:19.000
I like you're you're muted Michael just just share one other other thing that is is kind of unrelated.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:25.000
But I I had a a great conversation with Johannes Ernst.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Have you guys interacted with recognize the name I I haven't talked to yeah he you've been working on some hardware and and kind of software.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:51.000
Geared toward basically possessing and being able to look at all the data that you generate.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:58.000
But they have legal access to under, you know. Ceasing

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:07.000
I was, forget what it is Cc. A. What's the California Rdp.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Ccpa. I think Cc. something, you know

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000
You know that like, Okay, you got access to all that data.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:24.000
But then, what do you do with it? and you know it's like at the at the ideal.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:42.000
He's like making or has made a box it's something he's doing, I think, with next cloud and pull all the stuff onto it, and then it kind of gives you a way to look at it and you know and

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000
flips the dynamic it's it's just very close to my heart.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Just the idea of everybody having all the data that matters to them and sharing it proactively, intentionally.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Not 5 or 2 of existing. and the digital world

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.000
And yeah, I was. It was. It was a good conversation, just kind of first conversation, but I was curious.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:18.000
If you guys, if any of you or new app, yeah, no of them

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Interesting to hear more i'll tell you more

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Alright, I was gonna say, Michael, you should. I did tell him about the Cta.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Yeah, yeah, he was actually at the last cta meeting I i'd seen him a couple of times at a couple of different events.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:46.000
Then he he was that the Cta meeting? he

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.000
He also had shared at a mile data. Canada events.

00:59:50.000 --> 01:00:11.000
About those things working on steve vicka who's also, and cta I don't know their their connections between him and Doc Circles, who is you know Pm.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:28.000
World. and yeah, it's it's always it's always interesting to see who does and doesn't know if each other but yeah, he's he's onto the cta front

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Kind of we. we were having a little bit of debate, I mean.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:42.000
He was partly pooing interoperability as like if You're not interrupt interoperating by default with everyone.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I'll email and text does it really make sense to work hard, uninteroperable ability between a few platforms that cumulatively only have a fraction of the you know, the the potential consumers out there as opposed

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000
to building something anybody can use adversarily interoperating with.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:20.000
So, but for dropbox or stuff it's upset anyway, longer conversation, I guess.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Then I should have brought up at the very end but What's that keep it posted?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Yeah, yeah.
