## ActivityPub and ForgeFed 

### ActivityPub

- used in Solid (and Fediverse?)

### ForgeFed

> ForgeFed (formerly GitPub) is a decentralized federation protocol based on the W3C's ActivityPub, which extends ActivityStream 2.0. It provides a server to server API for pull request, forking and subscription of repositories provided by Git web services (services like GitHub, GitLab, Gogs, Gitea).

## Victor's Trove scopes (0h38m)

[Trove Scales & Scope](https://youtu.be/QwQaKZiljG4?t=2122) (Google sheet)

- cf. ZigZag ([Eric Rangell's ZigZag demo, OGM Thursday 2021-11-04](https://youtu.be/QwQaKZiljG4?t=2122))
- cf. Christopher Alexander's A Pattern Language (spatial hierarchy)
- cf. [Ross Mayfield's social group scales](https://web.archive.org/web/20061019095921/http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/2003/02/12.html) ("Ecosystem of Networks")

"zoom" (00h56m) (i.e., scale; zooming in and out)

- vs. schema, type

"groupings" (00h58m)

"Is the type maybe on the z axis?" (chat, 00h58m)

"Is there reallly and X and Y?" (00h59m) - maybe there aren't two axes

"There’s clearly a social axis; a type axis (which could be ordered by scale…); an activity axis (eg search vs edit vs share…)" (chat, 01h00m)

"different activities have different affordances" (01h05m)

"granularity"

group types by scale?  collections of types?

"don't try to shoehorn all your ..." (01h10m)

collect information both personally and collectively, and how to create a metaphor for that (00h19m)

- Interstellar bookshelf

- situating yourself in a territory is different from exploring a territory

Marc-Antoine: claims: consensus, polarizing, fringe (01h29m)


## Pete's OGM Thursday 2021-10-28 Hypertext Knowledge Workbook

A "hypertext knowledge workbook" distillation (or really, an unfinished one; it's an interesting but unfinished prototype) of last week's OGM Thursday 2021-10-28 call:

- [OGM Thursday 2021-10-28 workbook, website version](https://ogm-thursday-2021-10-28.openglobalmind.com/colophon), (pro tip, use the nav buttons at the top)

- [OGM Thursday 2021-10-28 downloadable zip](https://github.com/OpenGlobalMind/ogm-thursday-2021-10-28/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), download and unzip

If you open the unzipped directory in Obsidian.md, you'll get a better hypertext experience, but you can still get a lot of value just out of the text files, which can be viewed/edited with a text editor or a markdown editor.

[all the stuff about the zip file is for people who don't want to bother with git/github, and maybe not even Obsidian]
