- i loved
- i wish
- i wonder

## I Loved

Flotilla was a place where people who are really trying to get things to work together, come together and talk about it in detail.

Momentum of working together.

I love coming to the calls for the people.

Serious, but not solemn.

Talked about important things.

Good group size; we know each other well, so we don't need intros, and we could build working momentum over the weeks.

Having the group help figure out "burning frustrations".

## I Wish

I wish for a new website. :-)

I wish for two or three things to really weave and operate together.

I wish I had an easy way to look over the Flotilla knowledgebase and meeting notes.

## I Wonder

I wonder if there's some way we can all benefit from each others' successes.

I wonder if we could do a gardening session for 2021's links.

I wonder if we could be open about what we need.

- means we know what we need ourselves! :-)

I wonder if we could use tokens to recognize us sharing each other's ideas when those ideas are really valuable to us.

- getting credit for what we do
    - I wonder if we could do a session on this?
    - how do we want to be recognized, in social/economic ways.
- token discussions
    - Sprig (Pete) - Solana
    - Voz (David Bovill) - Polkadot

I wonder about:

- discovering what others have and what others need
- matchmakers who help others match haves and needs

I wonder if CTA could hire a 1) really good headhunter, and 2) a sociocracy ninja.

I wonder if we dont have a silo problem. OGM works great because of the philosophy "Strong opinions weakly held"

Service Discovery

Who, who, how can i help?

Doing matchmaking on top of the database.

The overhead of doing business with each other is smaller inside the business walls.

I wonder if we can all commit to keeping /now pages.

I wonder if we can all commit to publish our contact/profile details in an agreed-upon format, and then create aggregators for those profiles.

I wonder if we can share "project days" -- we pick one day in February for each project, and barn-raise for that project.
