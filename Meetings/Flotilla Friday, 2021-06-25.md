## Interoperability

- mapping objects between systems
- start with "thick" objects or "thin" objects

Factr's streams hold artifacts.

### Syndication Communication Channels
- API pull
- RSS feed
- something like [pingbacks / trackbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback)
    - [Pingback 1\.0](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback) (2002)

### Objects

- Person
    - Profiles
    - Identity for signing in
    - Social identity
    - Affiliation with other entities
- Organization
- Event
- Web URL (as lightweight resource; i.e., a bookmark)

How to disambiguate persons?
- how to decentralize (and coordinate) IDs?
    - [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) (W3C)
- Keybase as an example: using online artefacts as representations of me; and others can use them to make a judgement about the particular ID used.
    - "Keybase is a key directory that maps social media identities to encryption keys (including, but not limited to PGP keys) in a publicly auditable manner."
    - open source sigchains and user proofs: [keys\.pub](https://keys.pub/)

00:38:36, Peter Kaminski: @Bill, which part of Keybase?

00:43:43, Bill Anderson: keybase: using online artefacts as representations of me; and others can use them to make a judgement about the particular ID used (e.g., for me “band”)
