## Experiments

### non-Webflow

* firebase 
* flutter (bleah)
* bubble (yay!)

### Link Catalog

* Airtable
* Telegram bot
* idea: 'stripminer' script, to mine archives

#### Syntax

* :type:
  * like emojis in chat systems :-)
* #topic
* https://barelink.example.com/
  * has to start with https or www

## MaSVF Wiki

### Demo / Diagram

### Git (protocol, hubs, etc.)

* git the protocol / tool
  * decentralized / peer-to-peer
* hubs: GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, gittea, etc.

## Flotilla

### Federation/Syndication/Murmuration-ish Stuff

* really important
* MaSVF and [federated document creation and revision](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/ji61en34yfnn9g1ge5mdwj7hyw) is cool
* looks like we should get tools up first, then work on syndication/aggregation
* MaSVF-Catalist coordination
  * Vincent and Pete to stay in close touch going forward
    * "leaf" schemas from Catalist to help set up wiki page templates
    * URL structure / format of wiki pages (both wiki-specific, and semantics/information architecture of directory wikis) for Catalist to interoperate

### Catalist Status

* switching tech for scalability, but usable now at reasonable scale
* other app named "Catalist" (Likewise copycat)

### Directories Editability Prioritization

* self-edit vs. admin edit
* scope ("tag") to community
* timeframe
* amount of facilitation
* dev effort
* hard costs (e.g., Airtable Pro)

### Directories Rollout / Facilatation

* documentation
* 1- or 2-minute how-to videos
* demonstration / help meetings
* barn raisings
* "customer support" / helpdesk / facilitation team

### OGM Needs Directories/Dashboard

* people
* projects / quests
* guilds
* dashboard

Let's try to do both Catalist and MaSVF together.

### New Idea: Agreements Hub

* new Flotilla product quest
* 2-way agreements
* multiple-party agreements
* CICOLAB MOU quest
