WEBVTT

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
execution. Thank you. it's Nicholas Okay, back.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Join us. Yeah, thanks, Michael, for that reflection. And I think we were saying in that meeting, too, about male and female energies is is more almost more appropriate way to talk about it than gender remember talking about that too

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and Jonathan, to go back to what you were saying about the fact that both his live meetings, so that

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Yourself in a similar dynamic that we talked about cta contacts was how to.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I see how to asynchronous channels that let people's ability to communicate you know in in ways I think there's there's chat which I often find myself relatively silent in the meeting, but but active

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
cause it gives me a chance to like I was the thought It's about .

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Communicated, but also asynchronous measures that allow people to participate discussions for lack of a better time.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So ebay after the fact or you know from a different time, zone, or present something for discussion in a beforehand.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The form. How how that would manifest itself I don't know.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But so we were just talking about yeah, around what would otherwise be real time conference as a way to again label level of playing fuel, both in terms of the privilege and presentation ability.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And you know even things like site. they're hearing speech.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Yeah, thank you Great to be here. Yeah, and that makes me think of some tools and tactics that that are used to help those who tend to be quieter participate right?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Whether it's putting things in everyone, putting things in chat or the facilitator, saying, Hey, there's something important happening in chat.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I want to speak it into the room. or allowing for pauses and conversation for people to collect their thoughts, especially for those people who are thinking more deeply, you know, and that's too much information coming at them.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Like. If the conversation stops, then something richer can come out from from those people, I think, has, I know I have felt that helping me in meetings.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I think jerry's done a good job of over the months shifting some of his strategies and some of his ways of leading that have helped that somewhat.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:55.000
But still the people who attend the meeting are are not always listening to each other fully, and which makes it hard to build on ideas over the course of, and and finish the idea before it moves on to something else which makes it a little

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
chaotic, you know, in terms of emergent conversation.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It makes it a little more like a party chat sometimes, you know, party like we're just having lots of conversations with lots of different people, and it's not meant to be meaningful but I think it's really a space where the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:17.000
information is incredibly meaningful, and so sometimes it would be nice to slow down, and I think he's doing the best he can with the people in the room, and I think he does a fabulous job, but just trying to use that as

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
an example and and bouncing off of what you were saying.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Michael just made me think, you know those kinds of strategies confused a little more often, maybe, or breakout rooms, you know.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So people felt like they had a chance to talk with a smaller group and form some more thoughts before bringing it back.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:44.000
These are things I used to do in workshops and stuff, too. just, you know, in person they can be done, you know, in person or on zoom.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Also wonder if they're ways to it's funny i'm thinking back to the for example pete annotation.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000
For the

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:17.000
This circles back to sort of next one Costa, my constant desire for granularity in the the things that we say.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:40.000
But really cool if the means we're in our hands. for even when we're not for to be able to feed back on what's being said with, you know this is important interaction you know

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000
tag this thing that class is saying, Yeah.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Interact with the conversation in ways that are nonverbal and not even text.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
You know I I wonder even if there's i'm just thinking out loud here.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:22.000
But if there's a way to drop cash tags into the chat, as people are talking, so that meeting is being reported, there's a way of of hooking Pete I don't know if this is

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
something interest you from a developmental standpoint I don't know how one would do it.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:39.000
But oh, cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. cause it'd be great to be able to participate in a conversation.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Tag it, review it, applaud. it comes down and as as things are going on.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Not so. it's funny spirit and I were talking about this exact thing.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Yeah live response. and Jack Park came up with a the standard metaphor for human beings.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Trying to accomplish something is like herding cats, and if it hit to his point.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Everybody has an agenda, and they feel an enormous, impulsive need to pursue their agenda.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:08:00.000
This is the exact opposite of thinking and you know we're convinced that we're individuals, and that we're more important than everybody else, and that I think is at the root of this chaos Let me gather

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:16.000
together in groups. if i'm that way it's a way to act more important and every time I stimulated by something. someone says, I want to get in there and have to wait.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! and I I get the sense. We all feel that way. and

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
It goes to on this point of we're not so good at listening.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Well, if there was a way to be an active listener, and that have like, I think, Jonathan, you would get out a lot out of feeling like I I I do a lot of nodding, I do a lot of nodding and life

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
My wife is next to me laughing. but

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I try to do a lot of nodding on zoom calls because it's my way of like feeding back whoever speaking. you know.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I mean I forget sometimes. but but I think it's It's active in your listening in that way, and if that were, you know if that were sensed and recorded so that Jonathan you could feel the

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
nods when you make some point that that might be difficult for you.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:48.000
You know you feel like you're putting yourself out there on a limb by saying it, and to to feel the resonance that people have with that.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:57.000
You know the the meeting aren't there and likewise you would feel more actively involved, even when you don't feel like speaking.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:18.000
If you could, you know, make your record forward your presence on the recording of the call by, like, you know, here's a place where Jonathan really, you know, resonated with the point that gill was making and you know check, check the

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
comments to see if maybe, he added, a a point you know in chat.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I don't know that that's that's a missing piece that is, that is present that is present in the live conference.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:42.000
No, I see, cause we make eye contact and clear we're making eye contact and zoom can happen.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Yes, so there's a missing signal yeah and it's in it.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:03.000
It's it's an invisible thing okay how do you say it's a thing that because it's not visible. doesn't mean it's not there and because it's invisible we think it's not

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:12.000
there. and therefore we say, Hey, this isn't there it comes across as crazy talk.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Interesting. Yeah. So when I talk about patterning like figuring out what the patterns are that's bad

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
You're muted that's auto auto was just getting out of the car.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So I figured i'd give him a cam yeah ad adorable.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Now I don't know what I was saying because auto is So I literally totally yeah.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
It's a way of doing that, my last word was crazy.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Time Does that trigger it? No.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I I wanted to make a couple observations. when you set your talking about facilitation was really smart.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000
One of my observations, One of my observations is conversationally kind of you.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:32.000
You. if you want an outcome from from a group discussion, especially a bigger one, you really need to facilitate it to get the outcome. and ideally, you would have kind of negotiated with Everybody here's you know Here's what

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I think our shared goals are and let's you know and you tussle about what what you're trying to do and get very busy degree.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And then you facilitate in an environment where everybody's kind of signed up for the top.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Another thing about facilitation stuff or accommodation.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Actually, you know, purposely sewing down the conversation, or having everybody move to chat or doing breakout rooms, or anything like that.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:13.000
One of my observations about facilitation techniques is It's easy to think as a facilitator I'm going to do a particular thing, and that's going to help at least Some people do better the

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
other thing is not. everybody knows how to be facilitated.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Well, so just because you provide the capability for somebody to accommodate doesn't mean that they're going to do it by themselves sometimes as a facilitator, you have to help somebody take advantage of your accommodation

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
technique, so that they're you know it's actually like a two-step thing, where you have to try pretty hard.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I mean you. you have to actively facilitate.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Maybe if I can steal michael's word about active listening and and then the other thing is accommodation stuff help some people, and some people are kind of like whatever it, doesn't matter either way, i'm good and then some

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:06.000
people accommodation stuff just annoys them so I like when you know when I i'm meeting in a meeting you, you've flipped to different modes to pick up different people.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
But this hasn't happened to me all the time in Kicola.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
I used to wine about breakout rooms in in Lionsburg.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
You know it? Some of the accommodation stuff.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Is, I have observed it for me some accommodation.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Things that other people all obviously enjoy. just make it really hard for me to participate.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
You know it's like I probably wouldn't have come to this cough.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I knew we were going to be doing that and i'm just going to have to like Sit on my hands and like get through it, you know.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:45.000
So the it's a it's a whole interesting and and I guess you know, if we had a shared goal, and I knew they they accommodate it.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:54.000
If I got to speak into the room, Why, this accommodation is going to hurt me in participating during our shared goal, you know.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:05.000
That would make me feel better. I guess I guess a lot of times accommodation stuff when you just bringing on people without having it explain why this helps you know who it's helping.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Why some of us can be patient while we're not being helped or actually being hurt by it.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
All that kind of you know, Meta. Conversation about the facilitation, I think, is super helpful.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Yeah, I mean, you bring up some fabulous points, Peter and I have to be a little bit harsh, and in sharing that I heavy, I have experience.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:48.000
How do I say this cleanly, clearly, i've experienced some fabulous facilitation both in person and and not so much in zoom mostly in person, right which had the same elements that zoom could have and I've not seen

00:15:48.000 --> 00:16:03.000
that replicated in zoom ever and so having had been part of a program where the facilitation was so clean, so clear, so articulated.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
You knew exactly why you're going into this room you know exact room, you know.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Could it just been a group of us off on this, you know, find 3 people to talk to.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:28.000
These are strangers. Why am I talking to street? you know all that framing was beautifully done, and they laid out in a way that wasn't ever to taxing on the mind so that, like another thing often leaders and facilitators I

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:37.000
believe, make a mistake in telling everybody where they're going too much sometimes, because if you're if you're trying to lead someone somewhere.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000
But you're also allowing for emergence telling them exactly where they're going where they are going to end up.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:56.000
It's like you know but I don't want to go there like That's not where So if you if you lead them, and then everyone discovers they happen to be in the same spot you have this moment of magic that you lose

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
if you if you say this is what exactly where we're all headed it's kind of like being an assignment class.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000
My daughter talked this way, and for some reason I just made the association and the science class, and you're a student, and you don't know what the end result is of the science experiment.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Only the teacher does it. and if the t and if you're gonna do an experiment for an hour, and they teach tells you what the end of the experiment is at the beginning, why are you doing it it loses its fun of exploration and so

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:34.000
That's what i'm saying like that knowing that as the facilitator, understanding that and seating the whole thing it. and then being open to the fact that even as a facilitator you think it's gonna end here maybe it

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
won't and that's okay, too, being okay as a facilitator, it not going where you thought it was gonna go.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
You're not the only one learning in the room everyone's learning from each other right?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:57.000
All that kind of stuff is baking, that in I haven't yet to see that that was kind of what I was hoping for in Kiko Lab that never happened, and it takes an incredible amount of planning ahead of time with the

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
small team of people who are helping to do the breakout rooms.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And what messages are you gonna give, and at what time do you give them?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And exactly. what are you saying to help walk people through what They're supposed to be doing all that kind of stuff matters greatly and feel should feel incredibly subtle and supportive for the participants?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
But it takes an incredible amount of time before and after for the for the people facilitating.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
If we were doing that regularly in meetings we would get so much more out of it.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
But there needs to be a high level of commitment.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:34.000
By the ones running it in order to do that. Oh, that great Yeah.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:43.000
I also think it's fabulous to hear you say I've been in a meeting where amazing things happen.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Yes, I I think that's a key ingredient and and yet on the downside it makes us compare that meeting which was fabulous with any other meeting which is not as fabulous.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Yeah, but that's up to me to not judge but I do the same thing.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Okay, Well, all those meetings were Why, can't we do that here this sucks yeah, it's. and it's and it's I mean, I think that's just the life, right, we we if we experience something

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
that's fabulous and then fear experience something similar that's not as good.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Can we still get richness from the second experience and hold the judgment aside, because, recognizing that there's something still happening or making the call that this isn't for me, instead of sitting there disgruntled that that's also

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Okay, yeah, and i'm fascinated by the question of how do we bring the wonderful experience into this meeting for that meeting?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Well, and that's what you and I I mean we could talk about that here.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
If everyone wants to talk about that. but to me, I you know I did a couple years of training on that, so that's not.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And then also practice facilitating it myself for years, and had had measures of success doing it, and then going back to training and learning, and then coming back to spaces and correct crafting.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:22.000
I probably spent 10 years in that dance. and i'm not saying i'm excellent at it, but I did learn a lot about what works and what doesn't work.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
And why it was in. You know it was in the spheres of education.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:32.000
It was in the spheres of mostly, I would say in education, a little bit of mental health.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Of a crossover So I used it in spaces where I was talking to administrators and parents, and to students, and to

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000
But you know, could have been anywhere, really. and then my experience of it was

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
The the person that started it for me were 2 of the faculty.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
When I did my certification and positive psychology, which was a year long course.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:10.000
So it was weekly that we were getting this reinforced for a whole year, and he was just masterful at creating, And it's funny because he was a he's a very tal benjahar was the lead faculties

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
from Harvard, and you could tell he'd learned the techniques and been told.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
This is what he has to do. He literally had everything like measured down to the last minute.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Even his jokes were like planned jokes that he, you know.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:37.000
And so he was very methodical about it and yet he'd gotten to a point where it didn't feel methodical, receiving it, and it was it was a joy to unpack unpack it for me and being a process person I impacted every

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:55.000
single one in my mind as he was doing it i'm like I know why he's doing that, and I would make a little mental note to myself of the beauty of what was unfolding in the room because of his craft

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:05.000
I think that explains why you can grab the the time so naturally and run with it. Thanks.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
That's a nice compliment you're welcome planning.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Yeah, you're not your enemy. Oh, no worries i'm not mean to my enemies.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Oh, good point, so does that mean you're my enemy Oh, oh, no, don't go there.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:41.000
You'll drop yourself nuts, definitely my friends like Pete, I wanna read what you put in pattern language built by facilitators, port facilitators, group works deck patterns. my name.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Interesting. it's both a good pattern language and it's also good content.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:55.000
But but it's actually it is really for facilitators which doesn't mean I mean anybody can read them.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:18.000
But it means more to process people I I have a really close nearby question, which is and it was inspired by my Michael saying maybe, Michael said sometimes I don't talk very much, but I have a big conversation, in

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:33.000
the chat, which I think is great because it makes it makes us have more room for the topics basically make make make more room for the conversation kind of as a process person.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:45.000
It always makes me really sad when we end up having the live thing and the background thing and chat at least for me.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:24:01.000
I'm pretty good at multitasking actually that having both modes going at the same time, is hard and I feel like I can either attend to one or attend to the other kind of and if i'm attending to both then, i'm

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:09.000
suboptimizing, and my reaction when I see that happening sometimes in Ogm calls, actually, sometimes really bad.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:18.000
And Thursday calls are really good, depending and very often in the Mediterranean Meta project calls.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:27.000
It's like I wish we could just slow down and have one conversation, and actually kind of do what you just did one day, which is like, Okay, you know, something's bubbling up in Chat.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:36.000
And we're going to bring that into the space a little bit and and keep everything integrated, and it takes a lot of facilitation to do that.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:53.000
And there's a there's a weird thing and I do it a lot as a conversation is going on in a in the the visual audio stuff i'm dropping what I feel like is value-ad

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:01.000
metadata more or less you know links and things like that i'm not trying to have a conversation that's pulling the thing away.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:12.000
But i'm adding value to the the whole thing and you know in real time, and also as an artifact, I know that some people just get distracted by that, and they're wondering why there's always links going

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:24.000
on while there's also somebody trying to talk but there's so there's I guess that's an example for me of like chat can kind of be useful.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:32.000
If you use it, you know in moderation, and then I guess you have to also kind of accommodate for the people.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Maybe even if i'm dropping a link in you know, we should slow the meeting down, and it's like, Okay, why did you drop that link in and tell us a little bit more about it? the flip side of that Is meetings would go a lot

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:54.000
slower. We cover a lot less ground if we if we were kind of always integrating the chat back into the into the thing. but i'm not sure that's a bad thing, anyway.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
I kind of just wanted to bring that up, and and one of other people had thoughts.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
I do, I do I I first a complement to you. P.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Because i've come to depend on you putting the links in the chat, and i'm super grateful so many times somebody's saying something, and because the conversation was really quickly i'm like wait what what are they you know

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:33.000
internally. What are they talking about? That sounded really interesting? But I missed it, or or they don't even quite get the the phrasing right of it, of whatever the title of it was or and somehow magically you were able to pull

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
it out somewhere and within 15 s there's a you know a link in the chat.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
I think that's magical honestly I I would want you in every single meeting.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:55.000
I've facilitate to do that I think it only adds to the richness of the conversation that's happening in the room, and I love that you also make you don't just put the link you often put the a

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
little tiny little descriptor right before the link and I know why you do that.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:11.000
But i'm just telling you as a as a receiver of that. that's also super important, because when I go back scroll sometimes i'll scroll back through the chat during the discussion, and and grab things that now feel

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:19.000
more relevant than they did when they were first posted or whatever, and it would be impossible to make sense out of the links if you didn't put a little descriptor.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
So I think that's really a value add when I first came into this space.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
It confused me a little bit, for maybe half a meeting right?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
And then I started just oh, oh, these are links that have to do with, you know.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
But back then there were so many things being shared and phrases being used that I wasn't familiar with.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:48.000
So, if anything, it it was part of that onboarding confusion, not which is normal, not because of what you were doing.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
If anything, what you were doing help to help to help make more sense out of what's being talked about.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:09.000
So I I love that I also really like when people are having side conversations because it's an opportunity for them to connect with each other, and I don't mind that sometimes they'll be a really rich conversation and then other 2 Oh.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
let's meet offline right and then it peters out and that really wasn't meant for the room.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Really they don't mind that everybody saw it but it wasn't, something that needed to be spoken into the room, and I think it really sees to your point to pay attention to both is very hard and I think

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000
It takes a really strong facilitator to notice when something is happening in chat.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:42.000
And should be spoken into the room. and I do feel like Michael. A lot of the stuff that you add in chat is incredibly rich, and I do want it spoken and talked about.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:55.000
And the conversation is slow down to include it. just want you to know that my heart is always there with you when I see you folks things that I'm always feeling like, Oh, that's such a good comment that michael's making and now, we've

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:10.000
moved on. Okay? Oh, well, I want to thank you I mean I think I I have in the moment a couple of times when you've said, you know, you really should speak that into the room, Michael, You you know, and and and pushed me to

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000
do that. I I think I even dm do something once or twice, and you were like, you know.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Say that because I was feeling a little trepidish or whatever thanks. Yeah. So I don't.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
I don't Think the patterning is bad I think It's it's a little like the hurting cats thing, Jonathan was saying.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
It's a it can get unruly and it's hard to draw it back.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Once it starts to get unruly, and the more people there are in the meeting, the more the the more likely it is to get unruly.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:49.000
And you know I mentioned to my husband. Oh, in this great side conversation was happening in chat, and he goes. Wait!

00:29:49.000 --> 00:30:00.000
What, Alright, what what do you guys do he's like Well, that is considered so incredibly rude, and you know, he he said, when we're on zoom, no one would ever do that, and I think it's also I thought

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
about it a lot since, cause that comment was was a long time ago, and he's done it.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
He's made it again more recently and I I think it has to do with the nature right.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:24.000
If of a conversation. If a conversation is emergent there's a lot happening for people, and it needs, I I think it needs as many avenues as it can to come forth, how we make sense of that is the problem and then But when a conversation

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:33.000
is very hierarchical. We have these 4 tasks that need to get done today, you know, and everyone's pretty much an alignment, because we've been doing this work for 6 months, already. and we're just on to

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
the next 5 tasks for this week, you know that would be brood like. Why are you distracting me with this other right?

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:48.000
We have these 4 things to do. So I think it also just has to do with the nature and help me to see the that's just the nature of this

00:30:48.000 --> 00:31:00.000
The only other thought I have is what I brought up in Ogm this week, which was this idea that the conversation could get paused. and then people could be asked like, What is this generating for you?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
And give people a chance to to ultimately if it's facilitated.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Well connect on. Well, hey, I think I want to take this conversation and do this with it this week, and post that into chat, and give people a chance to see each other, and talk about potential synergies right to encourage the

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.000
synergies, instead of allowing them to happen asynchronously on chat.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:35.000
But to actually facilitate the synergies and and bring that into the room, if it needs to be talked about further, so that people aren't feeling like they have to do all the weaving on their own you know that

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:51.000
that crumbs for me the thought that i've i've sometimes had that you know when some somebody somebody says something

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Evocative, or you know noteworthy or something.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:26.000
After I it became a thing like maybe 4 months ago, i'm guessing 6 months ago, somewhere in there. for Pete to ask in Ogm for us to break for 30 s to absorb that thing which often seems to

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:36.000
me to be a bit of a damper on the energy that whatever that was provoked like isn't really what was called for.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:44.000
But you know sometimes it is, but often I mean not to criticize Pete, who is like I mean sorry that Jerry.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:52.000
I I guess, saying, Pete, when I mentioned, or you know Jerry.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Well and do that, and and I it it feels a little bit big footing or something.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:18.000
I mean it's just it, you know it's controlling and shutting off the comfort conversation, and as you were saying that I was thinking to myself, and I know, Pete, you like are the fan of this and in in other contexts

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
like Maybe it's a moment to say that's a really interesting point?

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:30.000
How about a waterfall on that you know let's let's not take a moment to just like internalize.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:50.000
But let's take a moment to think about how that resonates for us, and see what comes out of that, Because if everybody in the room like waterfalls, and you know a a predominant feeling is that made me want x

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.000
or you know, that made me feel unsafe, or whatever you know, that would be really useful.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:16.000
So yeah, just a thought. Yeah, I I in reaction to that, I have to say I did, felt that I felt like it was Mis timed yesterday after something I shared, and instead of it allowing people to process and then add to what I

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:24.000
shared instead. It diverted the conversation so it's interesting, you know, because it could have done the opposite the pause.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
And I think you you're your suggestion and how to facilitate is actually wise.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:35.000
But sometimes he's done that and and and I felt like it advanced to the conversation.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.000
People had a minute to reflect, and then add to it but I think coming out of it.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
It's almost like the facilitator needs to say so?

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Who has a reaction to what was just you know let's take this minute to to integrate this, and then we'll share prompt people to think about it. and then we'll share our thoughts on what was just shared and I

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:06.000
think sometimes jerry's framed it a little bit that way, and sometimes he's just left it as a pause, and even yesterday he said he was overwhelmed by every all of it.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
So I think he needed the pause. but it not necessarily.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:21.000
What was happening in the room. The room may not have needed the pause. Anyway, it doesn't matter it's it's just interesting, you know, and I note that you know if someone comes to the edge at some of something an

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:39.000
emergent conversation will allow for the on discomfort that being on the precipice of something creates, and what for the next person to get the slightest little sliver of insight, to add, and then slightest little silver of insight to

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:53.000
add, So that starts to build on itself, but you're playing at that edge of uncomfort discomfort at not knowing, not knowing if you've asked the right question, not knowing if you have the right answer, not knowing if this insight, is going

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:04.000
to be received, well, not knowing if great it's all it's like being in the classroom, and not understanding and being willing to raise your hand and ask a question, and a lot of people are uncomfortable with that with being in

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:12.000
that space that. but so I find an ogm when someone offers up me or or anyone else offers up something that's at that edge.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000
People quickly come back down from it and talk in spaces that they're more comfortable where they feel like they know information.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:30.000
And now that I say this actually realized that the topic of conversation someone raised in addition to ken's I can't remember. Ken raised one.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
And then someone raised some a different one and different potential topic.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
And I remember Jerry saying, Well, I don't know a lot about that, so I don't feel like we we should.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:48.000
We're ready to have that conversation. to me Oh, my God no That's the perfect conversation to have that's why it should be asked in spaces like this, because but it's a different conversation.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
It's a conversation at the edge of our knowing and We're not meant to know, but we'll explore it together.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
It's just different it's a different framing and it's a different experience.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
One that maybe isn't suited for ogm possibly and yet.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
There's a lot of stuff shared at ogm that is new, right?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:16.000
We just, but we tend to dance around it instead of actually sync into one of them.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:30.000
I'm i'm thinking, as you say that that this is it's an interesting thing, particularly about about otm conversations which, given their lack of structure, and you know half of them are check-ins and even the ones that

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:47.000
aren't check-ins or sort of a round robin that it's I mean the conversation that we've been having here today has, you know, very much built on itself and referred back to itself.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
And even the things that were seemingly unrelated, like Ai art.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:04.000
And you know meeting participation have like incorporated each other, and and I don't.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:20.000
I don't know how one I mean obviously we're advanced by the fact that there are only 4 of us and and here we are.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:31.000
But yeah, making conversations have room for and in all there's no judgment.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000
All the conversations are important, I think, they just exist at different stages of a of thinking different stages of a project kind of like being again.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
It's like being in a if you were in a science class.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:50.000
We can all imagine ourselves there. I think in a science class you're halfway through the experiment, and you start to get uncomfortable because it's not going quite right and you don't understand what you did wrong you combine the 2 things wrong or you

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
pointed the laser in the wrong, slightly wrong direction.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
It needs adjustment. Your teacher knows exactly what you did wrong.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
What does the teacher do? The teacher is going to get uncomfortable watching you be on comfortable.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Most teachers lot of teachers. a lot of parents will come forward and I'm. i'm guilty.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
We i'll come forward and solve it for you right it's that same.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:23.000
It's the same edge? of this person's learning we're trying to be at that edge together, which is even more uncomfortable, right?

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
And so, what ha! What do we tend to do when we bring ourselves to that edge?

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Do we want to resolve it really quickly? or do we want to play in that space of unknown?

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:42.000
And it playing in that space of unknown means it doesn't matter what degree I have, I don't know what the answer is, it doesn't matter what my title is I don't know what the answer is it doesn't matter how many

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
years of experience. I had I don't know what the answer is I don't know what the answer is.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
No one in this room knows what the answer is let's see if we can figure it out together.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Well that the logical mind you say Well, where does that come from?

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
We don't know. Where does that come from well where does the painting come from?

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Where does the poem come from? Where does somebody is getting their PHD.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
And adding one more tiny piece to the huge body of work that has already been known by Academia.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Where does that come from? it's the same same this we're just doing the same thing.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:25.000
We're just doing it through conversation, it's an idea somebody finally makes a connection and goes, Hey, you know what wrap battles and American Congress Congress are the same, and we all go you're crazy.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:33.000
And they go. No, this will be great and we get Hamilton. So I'm just right, like somebody will make a connection because of the people in the room.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Some new connection gets made and that's that's the association is is keeps, and we just we perpetuate that we learn how to build on that we learn to go wait somehow.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
That feels resonant to me. keep talking or wait that Oh, that makes sense to me!

00:40:49.000 --> 00:41:03.000
And here's how and the next person adds the next association, and it builds, and sometimes it doesn't make any sense, and sometimes you land something pretty genius either you don't know that's the fun of it if you're

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:21.000
willing to play. And then there's everybody needs to get their needs met. and this needs don't necessarily align with getting anything done Well, and here's the that's the challenge does this actually is this actually productive.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Right, and I can tell you from my experience, having done it in spaces over and over and over again, it is actually ironically more productive.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:41.000
You get to answers faster that are much more creative and much more of a win-win for everyone, Then what we think would have been the answer, Right?

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:50.000
So, because It's the mistakes right that it's the willingness to I mean every scientific experiment that was done for the first time.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Right all through the mistakes to to finally hit an understanding and if you're not willing to play in that area of mistakes.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:07.000
You can't get to the new thing you know getting paid and putting food on the table, and all that kind of stuff isn't gonna always come from the emergent right?

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000
So i'm talking about inception conversations not everything needs to be, and inception conversation.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Sometimes we just need to go to the supermarket I Don't need to create a new way to go to the supermarket know how to do it, but doing it for a really long time in fact, when ai tries to tell me

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
the great new way to go to the supermarket like to drive there.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:37.000
I'm going shut up or it tells me that I you know i'm going too fast, and i'm about to hit a tree when actually the curve goes round. i'm not going to hit the tree like every time the same

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:45.000
part in the road. It tells me that i'm about to I know what I'm doing right. so there are definitely times you do not need new new information.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.000
You you want to be able to feed that ai and and I it's funny, even before you brought up Ai.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:43:02.000
I was thinking about how like when you're talking about rap battles. I was thinking about ai prompt that battles air prompt battles or something.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:16.000
You know just that, like we want to be able to collaboratively and with control, not from the hidden Ai, but from an Ai.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:25.000
We manage and filter to be able to say, You know, I want this randomness from all public domain, art or music.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Or you know, combinations of letters, or whatever but I also want to wait W.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:44.000
E: Yeah, I t whichever wait. that, you know.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
You wanna say, Okay, like I want. I want the Ai in the background.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:57.000
But I want to wait for my actual experience to overrule it.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:08.000
You know, here here and here, and and then the ai is useful for like bringing up some alternatives because one of the great things about Pete. We have to talk more.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
I've been doing a bunch of ai art since we last talked about it.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:26.000
But you know the talking about making mistakes it's like everything you get from an ai art prompt is a mistake.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:40.000
It's like, you know how how to make how to just try a bunch of shit and just make hundreds of mistakes is what you're doing, and in a way that we would never like.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:59.000
If you if you sat down at a blank canvas even even if you have the skills to execute a piece of art to execute and fail as many times as I have in the past week on a I mean I've

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:14.000
i've let done. you know I mean i've done 100 canvases that that I would throw out or paint over, except I still have them, and if I want to go back and incorporate some element of one of them.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:22.000
into something in the future. I could not as easily now as I will be able to soon.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:33.000
But yeah i'm sorry blathering but you know I think there's there's overlap there in in Ai as mistake.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Mistake aid I love that yeah that's super cool there is definitely a role for Ai here, and I think there are times when there is some pattern that already exists that we're not aware of be really nice you know this is my leading edge

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:55.000
of understanding. and when Ai can go, Oh, yeah but that may be your edge. But here's a whole world of stuff that's already known.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
And here, what about this suggestion? This would fit in this would fit in the great?

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000
And then there's the edge of everyone's understanding or at least everyone in the room misunderstanding.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:12.000
And then that really needs human intervention. that's not something I right I don't think ai ever would have been rap battle, and you know American history right?

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000
So there's something unique that happens uniquely human that happens that can't be replaced.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:29.000
In making those truly creative insights truly creative artworks truly creative advancements that that is uniquely human.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:36.000
And I think we could be doing a better job of using technology to to support and create greater potential for

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:54.000
The books that i've read on I could try and find the title. Couple of books that I've read on creative spaces include included things like how more innovation just happens naturally in cities because people people bounce up against

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:09.000
each other and share ideas from different disciplines. And so that book talked about all the different areas where in history, where, say, different writers got together, or different scientists from different disciplines got together, and how they how that evolved both of

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000
their work much faster than if they just stayed within their silos.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:23.000
And so it made me think all along you know how can we use technology to break that for me was the beginning of we need to break down the silos because there's not enough cross pollination happening.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:31.000
And that's the cross pollination that creates the innovation So that we're not using it.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Some meetings are up opportunity for cross, and I I see a lot of wonderful ideas closing around like pollen.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:48:00.000
And this is good. Pollination happens when the particles actually arrives somewhere and fertilize hi!

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:14.000
I that for me brings up the concept that nonviolent communication folks draw attention to needs?

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:23.000
And their statement is that most of us and I agree don't know what our needs are of the moment.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:32.000
What would we? What would happen if, before a meeting everybody put down what their needs are.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Our expectations are for the meeting, and then we sat down and tried to figure out

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:44.000
How many of them can we serve? and Can we agree to serve just those?

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:57.000
And for people whose needs aren't being served in this manner are they okay with that, you know, would they be willing to help us, anyway?

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.000
That that frames i'm just thinking off the top of my head.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:14.000
But it seems to me that that would frame the energy and the effort in a way that's more natural.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:39.000
The emergent from yeah what's already there because people's needs drive cool, and especially if they don't know what those needs are, and especially if they're all gathered together with some quasi, sense of

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:47.000
let's meet the meta needs of the planet. and Then we ignored the needs of the individuals present.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:55.000
It's kind of Yeah, it's a whole you know so you're actually ignoring you know you're never really gonna solve the needs of the planet.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:03.000
If you're not solving the needs of the people or or even aware that you know what those needs are in the room.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:13.000
To to me you know. Oh, sorry, Well, it seems to me that needs are like fuel that you know.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:28.000
If you take that for fewer and one use it you're gonna get a very high performing engine terrible metaphor.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Sorry I I actually really love the concept that you're talking about Jonathan about, you know where is the motivation is what I hear you saying.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:45.000
You know. Where are People's motivations and to me needs is just one needs is one trauma is another.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Keeling is another. Learning is another. connecting is another.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:09.000
In my book. Oh, so when you put in, when you talk about needs, your your word for that is something that for me is more defended, it more discerning, you know, has has variations on a theme.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.000
So for you the word need is an umbrella term that encapsulates all the other things that I was saying.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:25.000
I need to be involved. I need to learn I need to understand something that's going on here.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:34.000
But I don't I I need to be included all those are very problem.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:45.000
To use your word motivations or speaking, listening, being present.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Then moving forward after the meeting is done, to do actions that forward the whatever they need forward it. Yeah.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:07.000
And when I talk about emergence this is good discernment, too, for me, because to me those are 2 very different kinds of meetings.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:19.000
One is let's learn from this meeting what is emerging for everyone in the room individually, and the other which is important.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:29.000
The other is what's look at and margin patterns and without discussing our individual needs as much.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Let's talk about what we're seeing as the greatest need in the community which may not necessarily be my personal greatest need, and see if what we can do to serve that greatest need right so to me.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:51.000
They're just slightly different ways of looking at something very similar one is more focused, and and they can happen inside the same meeting.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:00.000
It takes a different level of mastery. I think of following the flow of conversation to allow a tangential story to happen.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:13.000
That seems like it's just about one person or just about one community, and have that inform the total of the conversation around what we can do for everyone That's not something i've experienced in too many places that enough people can put

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:27.000
aside their own personal thing or their own personal story, in order to return to a collective conversation about where this might go, because then they get nervous that when it starts to go in a slightly different direction from what the thing that they expressed the

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:38.000
ego gets a little bit triggered so Anyway, i'm getting i'm getting deeper into this, and I don't know if it's interesting to everyone, but this is the kind of thing that when creating emergent spaces

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:47.000
I is the ideal and i've experienced those often but not in the spaces that we share together.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Yes, what is what i'm hoping for but I hear you saying is, some meetings get together to answer needs that Aren't. necessarily those of the individual participating.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Other meetings are exactly what they is that did I hear you right? i'm saying, there's 2 ways to go about it, because not everyone can combine the individual and the collective in one conversation.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:36.000
Then it it benefits the entire organization to break it down and allow people to share their individual stories or their individual needs, or their individual wants or their individual passions separately, because it helps people to focus on one thing at a time and then use

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:51.000
the data collected from that use another meeting to try to draw it all together right into and to focus on something that serves more than more than the individual, and serves a combination of the whole And start to prioritize here.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:55:03.000
We're gonna do this first and not that so that can be that that coordination effort can be hard for some people who have a very important need to be fulfilled.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000
That's incredibly urgent I have no food I have no water.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:17.000
I have no shelter. Those people shouldn't have to wait for some collaborative conversation to prioritize what they need is all i'm saying right?

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:36.000
So it everything's at scale and scope can needs to be hopefully led by people who are sensing into the building of energy around crises versus emergent patterns of need and want in a community versus things that are coming coming at

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000
10 years from now, but also still need seeds of action to begin now.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000
That will end up rippling out for 10 years. All of those things need to be considered.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:56:00.000
At the same time I ideally in the way that I see it. And yet there's there's never enough time for each topic to be fully articulated.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:06.000
And then pursued, and that for me the answer i've come to there.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:16.000
But this is we're still experimenting together. I think is that's where I think it ai can and technology in general could be a lot more supportive if someone has a question.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:24.000
And there's a known answer just not necessarily in their sphere? Is it something that that could be facilitated in a way that feels supportive?

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Because again, the feeling matters here greatly feel supportive and feels right.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:38.000
So if I'm. a farmer and i'm trying to figure out how to switch my farm to regenerative agriculture, and I'm struggling i've been struggling with my local board for for you know for the way that

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000
they write the laws. about how i'm on my land or I don't know. I don't know what the I'm making this up.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:53.000
But let's say I have struggle with that Oh, no that's been solved in this state, and that state and the other state, but none of that's being shared or coordinated right and it would it would answer and it would have saved

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000
me 2 years of effort, and thank God from getting the information now cause it'll send.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Save me from 3 more years of effort. I have the exact answer I need right here.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000
So, paving the way for each other and handing each other.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Solutions, I think, is there's a lot of a lot of potential there for easing suffering.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Does that ease at all? Absolutely not. But I would like to think that over time.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000
It would start checking off some I mean sounds so achievement oriented.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000
I don't mean to make it sound it would start easing naturally.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Suffering, and in a way that you know, a tight, knit community would have just done that for each other.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:37.000
Naturally in the past. Oh, this person suffering well let's go over and bring them, you know extra food or just wouldn't be it wouldn't have been discussed now.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:46.000
I barely know my neighbors right now I need next door to tell me what's going on in my my community, because it's bigger and more interconnected.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:54.000
And there's more there's more stuff going on So i'm just offering that up that what we're trying to do because we're trying to do it on a global scale.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Or in a much bigger scale. we need help can't this too much data, and to your point it can get very overwhelming.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:16.000
So how do we help to meet some of that hopefully in ways that that are both people oriented and tech-oriented in a way that people feel supported, heard, and seen, that in a way that serves them.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:22.000
I think it's the first time that tech has been developed enough where it can give people this kind of one to one relationship.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000
And bring them to, hey? You know what you really need.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:31.000
You really need a mentor here's a list of people that you might want to reach out to or put it. Would that be interesting to you?

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Check this off, and somebody will reach out to you. You know things like that.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:40.000
That just haven't existed in the past but I would say, used to be part of a titanic community.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Small small technique.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:10.000
I guess I worry about too much rationality, and not enough in motion creates a cartoon like sense of alienation.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000
If

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:30.000
If I I guess what i'm trying to say is I could attend 20 meetings, and still not get the sense that anything is actually resonating with me.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:46.000
And why is that important? Well, if nothing's resonating is isn't that an important thing to to notice is missing?

00:59:46.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I don't know the answer. to that but my instinct says it's very important and needs to be pointed out, and a request for guidance.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Somehow articulated to the right people, then, who are the right people?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:22.000
And Is any given group, the right people and the right any given meeting of those people the right moment?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:30.000
My experience is no it's almost never the right people and almost never the right time.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:38.000
And to me, you know. I question, John, are you Are you sure you have that right?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Or is there something? Is there something to this?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I wish I had the confidence to say Oh, yeah yeah i'm right?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Okay, No, I think you're right there's and I think the Yeah, I know where I know we're past the bottom of the hour.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
So just trying to come to a sense of conclusion. and then you and I can continue later.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Jonathan on this but it's about you know to to me what you keep drawing back to is the is is a need for human connection.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:25.000
That's what I hear in between your work and and technology cannot replace that .

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Period. It just Can't and ai will do a really bad job, according to some people who have those opinions I respect, I mean, I mean Covid was a perfect example of that right of how human connection.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Hurts. let me when we don't have sorry human connection. it really hurts even people who maybe didn't put much stock in it before as being something important.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000
It became really obvious. certainly all the science shows I mean that's just.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:07.000
We're wired for connection so if if it's if it. If there's a situation where somebody's in need of connection on any level for any reasons than any solution tech provides them is going to feel empty in my opinion, but

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:17.000
if what they need is information I think there's a lot of things that tech could be providing that doesn't need as much human assistance right now to pass.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
You know you don't necessarily need to go through a 4 for your degree to get a piece of information from another university.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
What was what i'm trying to say right so it's different.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:39.000
It's different, you know, and yet it might solve a problem or assist, and in in your efforts, or remove a need for you to go through so much effort to get to something Remove some gatekeepers remove you

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:47.000
know there's there's all reasons why I think tech can help, but it's not gonna replace connection, disagree.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:55.000
And i'm pleased to say it the situation is not that blink

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:04.000
There are certain kinds of conversations that forge connection and and deep in it.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And I i'm lucky to experience those on a regular basis, and I think it's in like I was saying earlier in comparison with those some of these meetings.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Feel

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:46.000
She like to me? they're making an error in where attention is being placed on ideas, and he goes and then

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:54.000
We're trying to wrap this up so i'm i'm reluctant to open up this further.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:06.000
So I think, take the technology is an important, overlooked component, and I think so.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Also is the ability to learn each of us as individuals how to connect really really well with at least one other person.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And if

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:39.000
And if and hmm I think i'll shut up

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I look forward to our conversation later. me, too.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I look forward to your conversation as well i'm glad you're having Could you stick a hearing from me here?

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:06.000
No, no, but but I mean sorry. Sorry, Jonathan, you go there. You go there.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:16.000
My own toenails. when I was a kid

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I'm sorry to hear that

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Yeah, my sister is so angry at at the way she was raised.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And yet she didn't receive half the the load is shit that I did so.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Thank you. I have such a low self esteem on that.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Yeah, I mean just to say, a lot of the people who might seem like they have higher self esteem are struggling to counteract.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:12.000
There low self-esteem so just being an honest, so i'm just being honest that's that's a step further, you know.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Good point. I don't know and my favorite conversations are ones where everybody can not where their mask.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Yeah, and just yeah, it's fucked up yeah i'm fucked up.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I just, I think those to use one of these words, those are far more productive than the ones where we're all pretending to be intellectual, and have the answers and and and and meanwhile experiencing imposter

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:00.000
syndrome. Yes, yeah. Plastic fantastic, hey? Thanks.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.000

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Thank you, Michael, for saying that to me. Sure, yes, I feel connected with you and with you, Pete, as a few.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000
And so yeah, really lovely conversation, not exactly like interoperable.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:33.000
But somehow, still, all the connection stuff comes out. It just came out on the queue inside a little more than the text sign that was really little more.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:56.000
