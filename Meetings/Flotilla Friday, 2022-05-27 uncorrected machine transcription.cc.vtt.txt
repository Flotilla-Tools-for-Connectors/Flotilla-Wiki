WEBVTT

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:24.000
about non-rival goods It's more what does the knowledge enable, and that's Valuable

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And this is totally a different thing than attention it's true Attention's valuable. that's interesting attention is was a way, I think, to introduce rivality in the non material economy.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Yeah, because attention, rival, the the the concept or we're dancing around is there's, you know people have said, Oh, there's a thing called attention economy and advertisers are buying for your attention as a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
rival good and you know, and you ought to be compensated for your attention in Yada.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Yada a lot of that is a economizing being human rather than economizing, you know. exchanging rival goods.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So so it is. it's kind of deep and bad Mike, like you, said Stacy. it's you know.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But but I it's interesting to hear you say that many people would agree with me that valuing attention as arrival good is is a good or not as a replicate is a is a good thing it's a a lot of people.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Would say, Oh, yeah, my attention, you know, cost me time and money and you know I want to be paid in time of money or or Facebook is observing my attention, you know, and they're gaining the you know economic value from that and all

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that It's it's it's a a badance Look, we slope So attention is really people being in connection with each other.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Right and when when and I I value that but I don't value that in the same way that I exchange you know $4 for a cabbage or something like that It's it's not money value

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000
it's human connection. Well, i'm also looking at it from the other way.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So like. we wanna educate people, we wanna give them knowledge, but then we wanna make them pay for it with their attention and with their money.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:44.000
No, but that But the question is, what winds up happening yeah, it's broken. That's how we got into this mouth and That's my point.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Yeah, Are you disagreeing really what mark mark and John I'm saying, Are you really disagreeing?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Not not clear to me. Yeah, I don't see how much disagreement actually between what you're saying right?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Everyone's saying like attention up an economy, built on attention only which is really not about you, and really about your eyeballs That, you know feed advertising like is not good.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So right I was put, I put in the chat engagement like what I when we're maybe using a different word, also helps right just going.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
If if we value engagement that comes with it. that we even that word to me comes with it a completely different perspective on it.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Now we're valuing the person for what they're in what you know what they're motivated to engage.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It could also lead, for instance, like if you contribute to the community and the community values what you contributed, I think both pieces have to be in there.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Then there's an account there can be an exchange for that.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So the exchange could be for what you've contributed and the value that's held by the community rather than you just being present or us shoving stuff at you right right Now it's the the the flow of funds is based

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000
on time right? and how much stuff you know you're paying for the stuff we dump onto you.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
What if we paid you for the stuff that you sense made and contribute back to the community

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I like the way this is progressing i've been thinking that human beings need a better motivation or a better better direction to motivate us in with currency attention engagement

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I wanted to strengthen the sense of benefit. if If 2 people meet and or or somebody sees an advertisement, and the result of that meeting benefits That person, then I know this is kind of ridiculous. and i'm i'm

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:32.000
crazy for suggesting it. But I love this idea of giving some kind of newfangled money to the person who created that benefit.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.000
At the moment the benefit occurred, and we have the technology to do this.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But i'm only suggesting in here, because hey? this is a good topic, or or one dear to my heart, and i'm kind of sleepy.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So benefit. If people were rewarded for benefit, they would create a lot more benefits than we currently do.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:14.000
We've grouted each other and or pet a rival risk in a petty manner.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I think it would be wonderful to motivate that away, or or at least, you know, diminish it a bit

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Hi! I i'd like to have use cases in the sense what is what is it?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Exactly concretely. we want to make a living from I think a lot of the attention economy started because people were writing articles, which is a far off sense, sneaking.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And they found that the only way to monetize those articles was publicity.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And attend the attention economy. So I think a use case is being paid for writing useful.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:18.000
But but here I think the engagement metric that wendy proposed is really interesting, because what's the measure of a good article, one that adds value to the community is it grabbing attention?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Or is it engaging in the way that you know other people are part of the conversation?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
It's constructive and the there's a whole conversation around it.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And another use case i'd like us to think about besides the journalist, because that's what we're talking about.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Are we paying for journalists? Are we paying for things which are public goods?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And are we paying for things which are have potential value?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:08.000
I mean the whole one of the most intelligent pro dow pro crypto. articles I read was about how it enables people to pay for things before they have immediate value, so that they might take the time to accrue

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
value, and i'm not sure it convinces me on the crypto thing, but certainly that is a use case.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:26.000
We need to be able to pay for thing before the add value, and, for that matter, I think no discussion of economy should not take into account.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:41.000
The fact that the real continuation of the human race depends on economically meaningless activities, such as having children teaching them.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:55.000
It's not it's absolutely essential and vital but it's not if you think of it in terms of I get something from what I invest it's absurd so economy is the wrong measure that's

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Oh, that shows, you! A lot of the real economy is actually so-called.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Gift economy economy, for which services are rendered with no hope of getting value out of there.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And that's fine I mean it's not fine that you can't make a living raising children that's a problem. But it's fine that this has not been captured by the economic capitalist cycle.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And this by their worst efforts with test you babies and surrogate motherhood, and all that over

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
They see. thanks for getting us started. This is a great conversation. I think.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I I value it. So I wanted to to kinda there's there's a couple value has 2 meanings, and when we start talking about money and finance and economy.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
We start talking about a trick that humans have figured out in the past.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I don't know a few 1,000 years where it's like

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Well let me back up so there's there's value as importance like

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.000
This this this conversation has is valuable to me and then there's value as a commodity.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So that's when I pay $3 for a coffee, or $6, or whatever don't buy coffee so valuing something as a commodity is is is an invention, right, saying that hey?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:55.000
If if if you give me 2 cows i'll give you 3 pigs, or if you give me 2 cows, i'll give you 6 bronze bronze, pieces, or if you give me 2 cows, i'll give

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:10.000
you a 100 bucks right that's a trick and it's a commoditization of of value, and and then, in the past, you know a couple of 1,000 years we wound up thinking that that's the only way.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000
That you can value something or one of the maybe not the only way that the strongest way you can value something.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I will give you an hour of my time for a $100 and you know it's a it's a very, very poor and very non-human way to to keep and buy.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:42.000
You So it's super valuable when I need a 1 million tons of brain, and I figure out how many dollars I would pay you for for that versus. You know somebody else's grain and talk about quality of the grain and

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000
stuff like that so it's a useful tool but it's

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I was gonna say wrong i'll i'll I won't say wrong.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:07.000
It's very dangerous to think that human activity and human connection is essentially a commodity. Because, then you end up in all kinds of weird places.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Right. Why is my hour worth a $100, and her hour is worth $200?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000
You know. there's different kinds of value and and import and context and stuff like that.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000
We, when so, so it's tempting to say you know something like my attention is worth time.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I want to participate in an attention economy. I want to sell you my attention, or I want to give you my attention.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
But then I want to get value back from it. and i'm going to count that value as a commodity.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
All of that stuff is it's it's dangerous it's close to evil right.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:05.000
It's it's it's using a tool that's super valuable when i'm working in steel, or you know cubic feet of natural gas or whatever it's a tool for that when you use that tool

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
on people. it's sharp and you know wrong it it it's dangerous.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:21.000
It. It hurts people. it mis values. things it means that teaches power is worth $25 and a computer developers hours worth $125.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And it's just stupid right it's like really stupid.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And then, and then we on top of that, we invent things like thinking about decisions in dollar terms rather than human terms, and we and we In the past couple of 100 years we invented ways of making money just with money

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and you know that's it just drives weird stuff and and you get headphones buying up companies and and dismembering them for parts rather than creating value as importance in the economy.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Right. So Marcantoon used a fancy economic term, which I wanna make sure that we kind of touch on real quick.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
That rival goods versus non rival goods.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And that just means a arrival. Good is something that there is kind of a set number of, and nobody can own on it.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000
In multiple copies right. if there if I have a head of cabbage, I have it, and you don't have it.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
If I give it to you I don't have it anymore.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000
So that's rival risk it's called it just means that one of us can have it, but not both at the same time.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Knowledge, information, and even to some extent, connection and attention, are are non rivalrous. Right?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:55.000
If if i'm giving you attention it's not like i'm using up the attention my attention and it's even dangerous to think I'm using up my time right you and I are creating something together that has a different kind

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:03.000
of value. So you know, thinking that i'm i'm spending an hour with you.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Rather than i'm creating value by by human connection it's it.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
It ends up in that dangerous kind of, you know, kind of thing.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So So then, we've we've also invented with copyright and licenses and stuff like that.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:38.000
We've invented the idea that culture and information and knowledge can be considered a rival good like if I buy a kindle book.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Amazon gave me a copy for that cop I a license for that particular copy of it, and I can't give it to you.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:16:06.000
All of that is just an invention right it's it's a way that publishers extract money from the movement of information, and that's kind of a good thing when when authors can eat it's kind of

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:21.000
a bad thing When publishers get rich so pretending that an ebook is arrival good it's it's a tool and kind of an interesting use of the tool and kind of a misuse of the tool it

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:37.000
means that that information we've humanity has hoarded it into places where you know we're pretending It's a pound of sugar rather than human knowledge that kind of would be good if everybody used it and

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:45.000
everybody would get lifted up by it right. so good enough for now.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Thanks, Pete. What What do you? What would be a human solution?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:05.000
You said I can't remember your exact words but you said something about it's just not very human.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Yeah, you know the the funny thing is it's human in a meta way.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Humans, I I think it's really I I have a I I value the art and skill of humans to make tools and use tools.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
So I think that's a human thing and when you're using the concept of money.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000
As especially to manage rival goods and you know allocate resources and stuff like that.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:46.000
I I think that's a a human thing to do But when you turn around and start valuing people as rival goods and money and their attention and their time and stuff like that it's so one of the one of

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
the tricks we started to started to invent 20 years ago, or something like that.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And Kevin. Actually, Kevin Jones was a big part of this.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Was like a 20 years, 15 years ago we came up with something called Triple Bottom line

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:12.000
So instead of just making profit, maybe we could have a a balance sheet for a company that's people planet profit right?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.000
How are people in benefiting in the community? How is the planet benefiting from, or or not benefiting?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
How is it? How is it getting destroyed by your actions?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000
So so for the longest time. when you know, we invented capitalism, and then we said, Okay.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
So you win or lose, based on how much money you've got right?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:47.000
How much. just capital and so the idea of of things like triple bottom line. There's a couple of names for it was the idea that let's use that accounting mechanism of of value.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
And we'll use it but but we won't just count money.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:59.000
We'll also account you know benefit to be able to benefit to planet. kind of as soon as as soon as I learned about that.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
It's like. Well, actually 3 is an interesting you know 3 is a lot better than one.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000
We're starting to realize that there's different kinds of value that a company might create or destroy. But there's probably a lot more than that.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Right. so I it. it never caught on I thought we would end up with lots multi-vary variable bottom lines.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:32.000
We haven't really I think so since i'm reading don have everything done of everything kind of informs me a little

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:45.000
The Different cultures throughout time and geography have have valued things in different ways.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And maybe they had a money system. but there was a lot of the.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
So So back to your your question, jonathan thank you it's a good question.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000
A lot of cultures value there, nobody in their community being hungry.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:11.000
For instance. and I think that's a really human thing to do right in our country.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Because of the way we do being counting it's like Well, you know, i'm walking past the person that person hasn't been able to eat for 3 days.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
And it's like hmm It would cost me money to make sure that they're fed, you know.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And and you know, then, I can go to my my local representatives, my government officials, and say, you know can't we allocate some of the city budget to you know feeding these people who aren't being fed and they're like

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Well, it would cost money. you know and so some of the cultures that the donna donna everything talks about graver and one grow talk about It's It's like you guys are fricking insane if you

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:01.000
think that a community member should be hungry right it's like well you know that's like so so in that way.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:12.000
That's that's an example I I could probably think of, you know we could think of a lot more kind of where I started with this was, you know.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Attention. economy versus if you don't think of your attention as a rival, good as you.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:27.000
If you think of it as a creative effort. that you participate with other people, I think that's a human way to do it right.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Valuing connection, vowing people learning and then and then, understanding that that's a qualitative thing and a an emotional thing, I I sense, you know I I I don't count up the amount of value that we

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000
created during this call in you know minutes, or hours or ideas or things like that. it's like emotionally.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
How do I feel? How do I feel like the the other people in this call felt

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Where have we traveled to? You know, kind of in our, in our thinking and our our ability to understand and and modulate ourselves better, and approach the world better, and help other people in the world?

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Right. All of that stuff is really fuzzy and qualitative, and and it's not something that I want to reduce to a number, you know.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Usually I mean there are actually cases I they're reducing things to numbers.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000
I'm! i'm getting a little bit away from money here. But it's it's another thing that people do right.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
You know. How did you? How do you judge the innovation of this meeting?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000
You know at the end of it, how do you you know what what's your feeling on a scale from 0 to to town?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Reducing things to a number is is another useful tool, but when we do it when we do it we have to be super careful to do it humanly.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:01.000
You mainly and It's often not done so thanks for the question.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Michael's hand has been up for really really really long time and he was skipped over a few times.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Thanks. Stacy. no, I mean it was, you know it it?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Jonathan was asking a question of of Pete from his hand up. so I got it.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
But I am. I am kind of brimming with like stuff to stay on this issue.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
This is, I I don't know if i'm even gonna be able to get coherent sentences out.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:41.000
This is this is so much my my jam. you know there there was something that there!

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:52.000
There was something that my parents taught me when I was a little kid that I that I loved 2 things actually, I mean one was that you know.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Here's your allowance, and every time you part with it you're voting, you know you're voting for more of that thing in the world not just getting the thing that it gets you

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:30.000
And so, you know. do you think about the fact that that you don't just get a piece of candy you vote for more candy in the world, and people wouldn't be healthy if there was just more and more candy and

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:39.000
not other things, and so just just keep it in mind you know not like you can't get candy, but just keep it in mind

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:56.000
And the other thing was they wanted to sleep late on Saturday mornings, and they told us, when you're watching the cartoons, There are these little things called commercials and commercials are there to trick you into like wanting

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:06.000
things that you don't really need and they you know talk a lot about the good stuff, and they they talk really softly and quickly about the bad stuff.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Butter is not included. So just just kind of take note of that.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:23.000
And so like when they woke up at noon, or whatever we would say, they said, battery is not included 6 times, you know, that, you know, and that was like we felt like that was our job to observe that so, like

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:36.000
being aware that that we are voting for more of things with our attention and and our clicks.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:52.000
I mean clicks are kind of the new dollars you know and and like you'd think i'm not paying anything It doesn't hurt anything if I click on the salacious you know, Johnny Depp Amber heard you know

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
clip Well, actually you're you're doing a lot right there.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:04.000
You're both spending your time and attention which could be better used in a more productive way.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:26.000
And your like getting Facebook or whatever platform this information is being presented on another set view which they can sell and add against which is money for them that you're not getting that in many cases the creator of the content isn't getting

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000
and you're saying let's make let's make this model.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Let's make more of this model and we've we've done it to the effect that we have made the model of information access for ourselves into add supported click bait, and the best. what whatever is the most effective in

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:01.000
gaining more clicks is the content there is the most of and of course that's not what we would call the highest quality.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Content is just the most engaging contact and we're I mean i'm worried that, like we're I mean, I I think, that we need to be more conscious that we are when you were saying when you're like interacting with an

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:33.000
end another individual and you're connecting with that person you're not, you know, paying attention.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:40.000
But I would say you certainly are and you're you're paying attention that you could be paying elsewhere.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000
You're doing much more valuable you're getting much more value for the attention you're paying.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Then, if you're sitting back and you know you know slack mapped at some engaging content and and so so at the my question is, am I paying or am I participating in importance? So I might am I paying

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000
you know. paying for a commodity. The the trick is using that word paying This is an economic mindset, Right?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Sure, but I the only reason I I think it's Okay, to use paying is that your attention?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:34.000
And your time are finite, and they can either lead to like I mean you could I mean you could come out of how, come up to commoditize yourself in many ways.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:50.000
You could say, like, you know, if you run the me out for the water contained in my body, and, you know, purified it and distilled it, and put it in plastic bottles on a shelf.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:00.000
It would be worth, you know, 5 99 or whatever you know that's that's a way of commoditizing yourself your finite self.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:09.000
But not a wise one. I I think attention is it's again.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Dangerous, I think, to think that attention is finite it It's kinda like, you know, is is love to to to sharpen the the point is love finite, or do we get more love by loving right sure sure when i'm

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
participating in an interesting thing, and and and we're having a great conversation.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:41.000
My attention doubles or triples. right. I get more attention by by participating

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Is is I mean you're You're you're getting more traction with your attention.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:30:00.000
That if your attention I mean you know I I only mean the attention is finite in the sense that the time time, time is fine, the waking hours you have to use your attention is finite.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:22.000
And you can spend time without any attention I suppose you know maybe you'd argue that that meditation in its best state is like, you know, not not paying attention while you're spending time, but but the time, being

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:36.000
finite I I Guess i'm using attention pretty much a surrogate for for time and that fruitful time spent fruitful attention spent.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
You're right, is additive and and you know at the same time.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:55.000
If you're interacting with somebody, you are both paying attention and being paid attention, you know the the video of of Johnny Depp and Amber hurt is not paying you attention, you know.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:08.000
So so it's so it's a bad exchange of intent of attention. and it's not additive and it's not rich, and it's not you know like love love creating more love.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:20.000
It's is not a time you you would you don't measure I wouldn't measure attention in time.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:31.000
And it's it's a trick of the the same People who invented the phrase attention and economy attention, Economy says attention equals dollars and dollars equals time.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Right. I attention to me is a lot more like love.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:43.000
It's it's flexible you know, spending 2 h of of meditating.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Maybe you know, maybe that's an infinite amount of attention right or more 0 amount of attention.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
I I couldn't tell but then attention.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:06.000
So if we say attention is more like engagement to use Wendy's word attention and engagement are things that you know, expand and contract their their

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:18.000
You know, 10 min in a really interesting conversation makes it so that I can spend another 10 min in continuing the conversation.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Right. 5, 3 min of watching Ember heard and Johnny Depp on on, Youtube.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
You know It's like Okay, Now I have to like go take a walk.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:46.000
I I have 0 attention right or something like that but the it's it's really is flexible and and multiple cave in a way that time or grains of rice, or something you know pounds is is not and and I think

00:32:46.000 --> 00:33:05.000
putting them together I think what you're saying, and what i'm I mean it's it's a engagement in the sense that you know the the industry uses attention and engagement.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
And and sells it then so they're commoditizing it.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:17.000
You're right that well used attention is multiplicative and and and good

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:34.000
But I mean it it's still it underlines to me Then what i'm saying that like you know don't spend it here where you're you know your commoditizing the water rung out of your body you're

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:48.000
just if you're making it just a kind of flat commodity that doesn't bring you anything back spend it here where it, where it's richer and and deeper, and and gives you gives gives you more so I I agree

00:33:48.000 --> 00:34:06.000
with that, except for the spend part right? Well, Okay, so you you decide to participate whatever. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know It's a mind virus, the the the capitalism and and you

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:15.000
know Homo economists and all that kind of stuff it's a mind virus, and i'm i'm i'm pushing it a little bit to make a point or to to to be an ass or something like

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:22.000
that I I don't mean to be an awesome sorry, Michael, but I think I think I also distracted you from.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Maybe there was another kind of point that you were. You were getting around there, which is time is actually finite.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:45.000
So you do spend time and this this, like the the the ad supported content like model

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:54.000
And the idea that every time the the you know, 2 terrible things are happening most of the time that we sit down in front of the screen.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:05.000
And you know this this being accept accepted, which is good, I mean this like speaks to your you know good use of of attention.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:25.000
But you know, somebody is trying to get us to spend time on something either spend time on something that we didn't really intend to spend time on, or wouldn't really choose to spend time on if we weren't you know it's

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:47.000
it's it's temptation and be there like taking down all the information about exactly what we're doing, and what what has that effect on us for the purposes of having that effect even more effectively you know the next time we sit

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:55.000
down at that screen like you know here you might be interested in this and you know the I I mean.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:03.000
I I know i'm like not telling you guys anything you don't know. i'm sorry but it's it's.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:21.000
I guess the control of one's. focus and time and attention is to me more of a right, then, you know if there's anything that needs to be legislated.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:47.000
It's not all this stuff about like moderation and stuff it's literally the idea that, like I have the right to my own attention, and and I have the right to know to know the stuff that can be derived about myself, so that I

00:36:47.000 --> 00:37:07.000
can use myself, my my skills, my love, my attention, the most effectively for myself, and that there are forces that are like literally aimed at thwarting you and doing that is pretty tragic.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:17.000
And and and seems to me like something that is you know that there's some evil that

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:25.000
But maybe you know. Certainly we can we can going going back to Wendy's point yesterday about making change.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:35.000
I mean there's certainly ways that we can be different about it, but also need to push toward changes being made in the way the economy works.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Because we're getting secondary effects even if we're not participating, anyway.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Sorry. but there's my words view thanks Yes, I just wanna bring in stuff that's been happening in the chat and bring in a point I was bringing up earlier with like services.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Right. So, separating the idea of services which I think is where you were going, Michael, too.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Maybe i'm just freezing it. a little bit differently But I'm agreeing with what you what you're getting at, I think, which is, you know, commodities stuff right and Then services like humans providing services to each

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:28.000
other, or the Government providing services to humans or you know whatever right and the services to me are our our where the come where this conversation is.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
That's the way i'm freezing and my head is you know services.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:45.000
We're providing, and what kind of value do we have and I'm. suggesting that if the value is one at least one, if not most, of the measurements of the value of that service is in how well it affects human

00:38:45.000 --> 00:39:00.000
flourishing, or how well it affects human well-being that that would. those measurements would be a much better way of making decisions based on policies or rules or laws, or right things like that which really don't those those those aspects

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
don't even come into the decision making process often but they are starting to.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:18.000
They're definitely you know. Gdh is out there and some. Some countries are starting to use Gdh as a way and have been for for a decade have been using it as a way to to make decisions and it

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:29.000
does have a huge outcome in terms of people's It it actually costs less in the long term to make decisions based on those things.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Because then you don't you you the the system is designed to pick up on symptoms of lack of you know of well-being, so the lack of well-being doesn't become crisis before and then the system has to

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:56.000
pay a lot more to fix the crisis than it does to to perpetuate well-being right and just the the impact of that kind of thinking, that kind of feedback on health, on education.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.000
On. I mean just every sector society is huge so I think that would be an interesting, you know, furthering of our conversation.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:11.000
And i'm gonna put a quote in the chat right now which came from one of my teachers where attention goes, energy flows right?

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:27.000
So we're talking about attention, I used to use this quote, and in parenting classes, right to help parents understand that most of what kids are looking for is connection, and that if they can't get the connection the way they want

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000
they'll create a ruckus to get to get attention because some sort of attention is better than no attention.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:41.000
So recognize parents like where you put your attention. matters so what happens if you start putting your attention on the things that your child is doing.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
That's good which often gets no comment whatsoever what if you actually start commenting on that.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.000
What happens, And just what happens is the kid starts doing more of it because they want the attention.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.000
And now you've given them a perfect excuse to get attention in ways that you actually want them to be doing right.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
So you reinforcing the behavior makes common sense but we often don't run things that way.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:11.000
We often don't make decisions based on that kind of stuff another example, much more complex.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:24.000
My mom went through a bunch of surgeries over a 7 to 10 year period, and in that time it was at Yale, New Haven, Pasta Yale, New Haven's medical system here in Connecticut, took over

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Bridgeport Hospital, where she was getting All these done so.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:40.000
There were few surgeries before they took over, and there are a few surgeries after after they took over, and the difference between the between before and after was dramatic and the main thing they did when they took over is put in a

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:48.000
survey that surveyed people when they left, of what their experience was like and what went wrong, and what went right, and all those kinds of things.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
And they improved things based on this, on these surveys.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:03.000
And instead of me having, like panicking, having to be in the hospital to advocate for my mom's health, I could visit her for 15 min, and know she was well taken care of I mean the complete 180 so I'm just

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
saying right, whatever decisions that that that that feedback loop created for the medical system.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Completely changed everything about the way they were operating and i'm guessing they became more profitable because it's been a working model that they've been working with.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Now, for you know for for 10 years or whatever so anyway, i'm just i'm throwing this in as as another kind of slice, and maybe a maybe somewhat of a summary of what we've been talking about as a as a

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000
contribution back to to this very rich and awesome conversation.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Thank you. Yeah, I just I just wanna apologize. I I started this conversation.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
I want to apologize for Pete I didn't mean to cut you off, and I really loved what you had to say.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:55.000
I was just watching Michael for so long, and I knew he had so much to say, and it was it was killing me, and I want to apologize to Vincent because i'm getting the sense.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:04.000
This is not the conversation we wanted to have, and I do hope we can continue this at another time elsewhere. So oh!

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:17.000
And I just want to very quickly you know Michael was lucky enough to have parents that gave him that information about the commercials, and I guess i'm really concerned, and making sure that people that don't have parents that can give them

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:39.000
that information. Get that information So that's where when I think of Kevin, and the way he looks at community I feel like i'm in alignment there, but more with information thank you

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:46.000
My my friend on that front my friends are my best friend's a middle school teacher, and she she's a science teacher.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:58.000
But one time, she said to her class, you guys all know you're walking around getting free advertising to every to all these places that you're wearing teachers for and that you spent a lot of money to put that t-shirt on

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
your body to walk around and give them free advertising.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000
You know that right just. She was just having fun like lobbying that in there.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
And all of a sudden the number of the number of every all the kids went.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Oh, like I know. Oh, right so important little things like that, right?

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
And I just wanna say if they were given that shirt free and they needed a shirt to wear.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:29.000
I have no problem with that, because at least that's balancing it out, and that's all i'm looking to do balance things out of it.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000
But instead they paid a premium for it, but right which was her, which was very true.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:45.000
In that room. Yes,

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
I gotta run everybody i'm gonna stay by so nice to see everyone.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:45:02.000
I i'm away next week i'll see you in 2 bye, I

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:09.000
That's happened other I wanted to throw some men the word thrive.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Comes to mind, Yeah, gross, global thriving of human beings.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:27.000
I if I think most of us wouldn't be surprised if that number was really low.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:40.000
And I I would love to see that the raised and what kind of force could we invent that?

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Would raise it

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Hi! that's what we all work on right that's what I work on every day for .

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:02.000
This network alright. then, I I guess i'm working on it, too.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Hey? I wanna mention thrivability as a word.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:18.000
That my friend Jean russell was pushing she kind of I I mean it's a generic word, but she kind of pushed it into being.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:27.000
I think I like it and And it was a reaction actually to the word sustainability.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.000
So you know, if which you know, which itself is a reaction to other things.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:41.000
But we kind of got stuck on and and sustainability got big because it's better than than the alternative.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:55.000
But we should go for her her thing was basically okay so sustainability. If you know, if if we're not careful, it will just mean that we're keeping things the same, and that we're surviving what if we were

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:16.000
thriving. What if we had trivability i've been I've been thinking a lot about like the the verbiage around like there's there's one tag that I hear on you know npr

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:23.000
underwriting, you know word blips and i'm trying to remember.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:31.000
I think it's the andenberg or any d Casey, or some some foundation, says

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:39.000
They are like in support of a just and verdant world and you know I don't.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:48:02.000
I don't think that really that's not the one but I really appreciate the effort to like to distill You know what what it is that the world old should be and and thriving is like you know thriving would

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:18.000
fit in there, you know. a thriving, verdant just world says, you know, people on the planet should be doing good and and and being treated fairly and

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:29.000
So. yeah, I I hear thrive and and , cool plus I think it's just retarded that we're not doing that already.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Let's see what a stupid way to run the species Sorry for my vitriol.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Yeah, I just think we gotta Ruthie, get our good dose of humbled by regarding you know what we think is important.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:09.000
But we should spend our time doing as to thriving There's another dimension to it, which is as individuals.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:19.000
We don't look at whether we're thriving it's just like desperately trying to sustain ourselves.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Yeah, that I you know the same it's the same problem on an individual basis, as it is in a community and global basis.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:48.000
And we're we're just teaching ourselves to think unhealthy things, and create habits that aren't healthy.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:59.000
We certainly there's a lot of not thriving going on

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000
I like your answer, Pete and Mike and Stacy.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:18.000
They're all wonderful optimistic and encouraging the way I hear them.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:28.000
So my hats in the ring here

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:35.000
I'm thinking, i'm gonna leave at the hour to go watch Grace and ken that sounds like a good.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:42.000
The good thing Can we see if Vincent had anything he wanted to share about something else, cause I can.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Can you leave a link to grace and ken's yeah, just put in, child, Thanks.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Thanks for asking Stacey. I think I don't have anything really burning.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:10.000
But just still feeling the need to close some past open open loops to you to put it out that way.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Over opening new ones. So i've been working on and thinking more about Pete, what you mentioned with kind of like personas and user stories.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:42.000
So i've been doing some work on that and I made like a person as air table database that I've been working on, and then the only other update I have which is kind of cool is that have gotten 3 like

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:51.000
2 way syncs with catalysts and air table going so each one is kind of unique and set up, but once it's set up, it's kind of automated.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:52:00.000
So one when somebody buys a ticket if the ticket event has an air table base, it'll write the information.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000
The payment information that ticket into a payments table in the air table.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Another one is in the tapestry. When a new record is entered it will add it to the air table, and then the third one is

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.000
This is kind of like the the Meta schema.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:41.000
So when a new location is added, So for example if somebody tags a community, and says this community is from Long Beach, New York, and that's not a location that's in the database of like all the States

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:49.000
country cities. It'll add it as a new location in an air table database which has kind of like the updated list of all the locations.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:58.000
So that's been fun. getting some like 2 way sinking, going, and just playing around with the the air table.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Api a bit good progress since then. I done of everything kind of

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000
One of the things when the outputs have done everything.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Book Club book circle is very references to other books.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000
So I was going to start keeping a list of those someplace.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000
I think catalyst is a good place to do it so i'll be doing that.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:41.000
I think, and you know and and what's the start maybe Vincent, i'll kind of make books a little bit more first class, or maybe there's another thing that should sink with catalyst and and add

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.000
more beginning to think about things like that, cause we get a lot of book really.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:55.000
I mean, not a lot. We get a handfuls, but of really important books to know about.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:02.000
So and we you've been doing that for a year and a half and or 2 years, and they they kind of just drift into the ether.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:12.000
So It'd be nice to keep track of them yeah pizza as as your cattleing things view feel free to shoot me at a Dm.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:24.000
If you're like business, it needs a field for like the book idea like, or something like that, we'll do Thanks, Anthony.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Thanks, everybody.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:55:05.000
I'm heading out too
