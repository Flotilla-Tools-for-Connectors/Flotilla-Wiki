## Dashboard of OGM projects

- Trove!
- OGM Wiki? (does Massive Wiki have an API?)
- sibling of Distributed Directory Project?

Some design questions:

* What is a project?
* Who speaks for it?
    * "ambassador" vs. "leader", "leadership"
    * "leaderless"
    * in group dynamics there is a vocab of distributing authority such as ambassadors, decision makers, observers, plenipotentiary, etc.
* How do they keep the directory entry updated?
* How does it syndicate more detail (project roadmap, task list, resources needed)
    * Into the directory?
    * Into the world?
* How do people know how to find the directory?
* How do people know how to use the directory?

> @Vincent, i think the answers are generally yes, but it would be good for you to sync up with Jerry about it.

Peter Kaminski
> i think the question/answer is the complement: how can I tell the world my project is part of OGM?  and i think the answer is adding a hashtag, #OpenGlobalMind
