> If we provide a grid, a framework, to help guide pieces of the puzzle into the right general area, then that greatly increases the chances that we start finding connections. The faster the connections get made, the sooner new synergies are found. Now they're not pieces of a puzzle, they're threads in a tapestry. The act of weaving begins and images start to emerge more clearly. A flower here, a fence there, a tree and a strawberry. Transformation comes with the motion, the collaboration, the excitement over what might come next.
