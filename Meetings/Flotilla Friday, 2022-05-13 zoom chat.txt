00:21:31	Wendy McLean, NY:	meta project, vs Meta Project vs #metaproject
00:22:45	Jonathan Sand:	Practitioner‚Äôs guild for harvesting and composting
00:23:38	Wendy McLean, NY:	How about this:  I have my thing, and I'm working towards the one Meta Project, and I‚Äôm also seeing synergies with meta project which hopefully will benefit from what I'm doing.  Together with everyone contributing pieces to the meta project, we will eventually coalesce everything that is already working towards the Meta Project.
00:24:33	Jonathan Sand:	Conceptualizing vs. Operationalizing
00:28:17	Jonathan Sand:	Interoperability
00:33:59	Jonathan Sand:	meta project will codify sovereign-generated information

00:43:04	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	The environmental movement (#environmentalmovement) is analogous to the meta project (#metaproject). No one owns either. But millions already work for it. We (we 50-odd folk) are recognizing, synthesizing, and ‚Äîforgive me‚Äîare relative newbies. Indigenous cultures have been part of it for millennia. Lionsberg (and maybe specifically ‚ÄúThe Lionsberg Fund forAdvancement of the Metaproject‚Äù) is one of many sovereigns trying to push recognition of this movement, the way the Environmental Defense Fund, the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and League of Conservation Voters, and skews of individuals, and books, and conferences ‚Äúwork for‚Äù the environmental movement.
00:52:28	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	The best names are nonsense words.
00:54:09	Jonathan Sand:	+1 Michael non-nonsense word names have huge friction forever regarding ‚Äúwhat does this word really mean in this context?‚Äù
00:54:20	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	Evocative nonsese words that you make mean something.
00:54:33	Wendy McLean, NY:	Agree Michael!
00:56:53	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	Agree about Lionsberg. I‚Äôm girding myself to mention that to Jordan ;)
01:01:21	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	Lionsberg vibe is kinda Game of Thrones old, male, English, heraldic. But that ship (with a carved dragon on the prow) might have sailed for him.
01:02:47	Jonathan Sand:	Plus ‚ÄúLionsberg‚Äù is a mysterious reference to an as-yet-unknown
01:03:52	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	I have something to share that Jonathan and I worked on related to directories and interoperability üòÑ
01:03:56	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	Pete can you put the hackMD link in the chat again? Missed it, can‚Äôt quite read in Zoom
01:04:01	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	but okay if it waits
01:04:10	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	Yes, pete üôÇ

01:29:10	Brad deGraf:	By all, thanks
01:40:59	Jonathan Sand:	Crowd-sourcing collaborative action
01:49:26	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	Hypothesis: The things are the same if the relationships are mostly the same
01:49:53	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	And if there are differences, then that means they are "sub-types‚Äù instead of different things
01:50:09	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	This is so rich! I think we‚Äôre making some good metaprogress today.
01:50:14	Pete Kaminski:	nice hypothesis!
01:51:50	Wendy McLean, NY:	Thanks for noticing that, Pete!
