# Flotilla Friday, 2021-04-02

## Agenda

- calendar
- free-form profile/directory pages on OGM Wiki
- should we have a Flotilla massive wiki?

## Calendar

- Airtable multi-sync -- two-way sync with multiple Google calendars
    - = federated Google calendars, viewable on Catalist

### Functionality
- very quickly input data into shared calendar
- handle various events at various levels of openness and privacy
    - findability / friction (more or less depending on what you want)
    - knowing the intentionality of setting up and publishing your event
- being able to update events

### Testing and Getting Feedback
- easy way to get people to use it and get feedback

### Make Calendar a First-Class Project
- how to resource it?
- Pete's sharing picture of architectural "secret sauce" - [Slack notifications flowchart](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ZGZ9a-m8yNrliqppeU1qJg.jpeg)

### Resourcing

- say there's a straw budget need for first six months (dev, design, marketing) = $250k at retail salaries
- pay half that for "non-profit" pricing?
- sweat equity?  (but need a revenue model for that)
- hybrid commercial / commons model?
    - inspiration: Alex + Internet Archive
- wordpress model?
    - open source software
    - preferred service vendor makes revenue
- b2b product?
    - revenue comes from managing private business events
    - data commons, stewarded by catalist
    - like github, if it's open it's free

## Other companies

- eventbrite
