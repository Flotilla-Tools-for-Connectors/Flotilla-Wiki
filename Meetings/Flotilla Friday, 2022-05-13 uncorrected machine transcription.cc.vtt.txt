WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I cannot. I I , I spent about a half an hour trying to find how to turn that on, and realized I didn't have the the right like account for it.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is tila Friday Friday, the thirteenth, May thirteenth 2022.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Yes, as I have an agenda item for today something i'd really like help thinking through, or just to propose to see what people, what people's thoughts are that I think are very very flotilla B So that's

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000
me. I can either dive in. but I didn't know what other people had in my class,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Let's see if i'm able you guys tell me that you can't hear me.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If you can't hear me good thing we can hear you ask that question, then?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Okay. yeah. just to the to the question earlier that I'm thinking about in terms of you know, I wanted to ask you about Pete in terms of developing the website.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And speaks to the whole you know what you'll find on catalyst.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:28.000
What you'll find whatever platform I keep stressing to me the the definitional if you of what meta project is in the eyes of a new bee, and what winesburg is, and and p you make the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
distinction, You know. I think interestingly about my habitat.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Meta project all over. Text One word Use of metal Project versus matter Project Capital L.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And capital p versus when it's associated with Lionsburg, or not, because it it seems so critical to me to.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:12.000
For onboarding other people that you know Lionsburg Doesn't own the matter project, and that you know catalyst or factor, Massive Wiki Doesn't own the directory of the meta project that the meta project

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000
is bigger than us. I I may be like wrong in in approaching it that way.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Maybe Meta project is It's something that I wanna talk to Jordan, and I have had some talks about branding, and you know, and branding Lions bird versus branding meta project versus branding lines

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:56.000
meta project to me. Seems like a important question so i'm. I guess i'm just i'm just putting that out there just to emphasize that that feeling of of what people get when they encounter us talking

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:12.000
about this thing. and and ask the question of like how Pete you're addressing that in what you're doing with with Lionsburg space Capital, M.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Meta Space Capital P. project it. that seems like a thing definitely a thing, cause we're having trouble talking about it. So it needs to eventually figure yourself.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I I I had to . I think I back channeled Michael about this earlier today is like, Did I really turned out?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I really needed the lowercase. Meta project. It was a super helpful concept to have this week, Wendy. is it okay?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:58.000
If we dig in on this a little bit, and then helps in my mind, helped me to define what Meta.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:10.000
But then a project is so i'm happy to approach it that way First, If you wanted me to describe mine, go for it, whatever i'll i'll go for it and and maybe try to tell the story of the the lowercase one for

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
me really popped it. It was conceptual when Michael was Bring it up on a zoom call.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And then this week is like Oh, I get it because somebody who's involved in the capitalized meta Project

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It's like Okay, let's do this thing and I I could tell that that they were thinking that the meta project kind of is this container for stuff.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Right and and it's the owner of these sub projects and stuff like that. and i'm like dude you know. i'm i'm doing a thing, and i'm going to keep doing this thing and you know whether or

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:59.000
not you know Jordan likes it or doesn't like it, or whatever I think it's part of you know lowercase than Meta Project, and i'm gonna keep doing it so.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I guess I guess this was it. was creating the creating the community of practice practitioners, guild for harvesting and composting and and it and it surprised me even and it's surprised a few folks it's like okay,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
but you're talking about this you know community practice and you're going.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Let's go. Talk to people who Aren't in the meta project and include them in this guild, and i'm like, Yeah, of course, that you know, of course, you don't have to be in the capitalized Meta project.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
To be part of this community or practice, because it's a autonomous sovereign right?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And you know and i'm working on behalf of the lowercase.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Meta project you know like i've been doing for and then I I think back to some of the things that I've been doing that align with meta project i've been doing it for 1023 years.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And it's like you know that's you know whether or not you call it the meta project that's what it is kind of.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So it really brought in the sharp focus for me the you know we we can't.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
We can't pretend that we own the meta project or Lionsbury can't pretend that it owns them.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Meta Project when there are people who don't even know about Lionsburg like 10 years ago.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I didn't know about lionsburg and I was doing you know lowercase Meta project things even now you know somebody who's working on the stuff that you know is meta Project ish lowercase.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:56.000
You know, you wouldn't say Oh, you know I you can't do that because it's not capitalized meta project does make sense, or whatever it's like the lowercase one so so the other thing I wanted

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
to mention in there. and this is a little bit off.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
The top while it's on the topic of the name of Meta project.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And it's a little, maybe a challenge or a a thing of interest for Michael and Jordan.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Grace did a really funny thing on the O.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Jim call yesterday where grace got started talking and she's like, and you know, and she wanted to say something about Meta Project capital, you know, capitalized.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
She didn't say capitalized but she meant you know the matter project. She says that's a funny it's a funny name.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It's a pretentious name i'll call the pretentious project, and she just kept going, you know, and i'm like I had to laugh, and it's like you know cause in her grace way.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
She's entirely correct. you know and and you know I I can't say no.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It's you know not the pretentious project There really is a thing called the you know capital M. capital P.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:00.000
A matter project, and it's like that's the way it is you know people are gonna see us and perceive us the way it is, and even me, you know, sometimes i'm working for Lionsberg and Jordan and

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000
it's the capital m capital p and sometimes i'm doing my thing, and I think it's meta project and you know It's the lowercase.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:22.000
One. So it's a little confusing a little bit hard to graph. but it's it's a thing and all of those things

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Jennifer, you had your hand up. Do you want to go first?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Yeah, I think i'll i'll try and be quick

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:51.000
There's the way I hear what you're saying pete resonates really strongly with me in the sense that we're all coming from wherever we were before we joined up here, and probably did a lot of thinking along the

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:04.000
way, and are continuing to do it after we arrived. and I for one, also have ideas that are not any incorporated into capital. M.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Capital b and you know i'm I and contribute them or not now. i'm gonna continue to hold on to them because they're precious to me.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:32.000
That's how I hear what you're saying and it's like a relief to hear someone else say it

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I think that. So that's why? what you're focusing on Pete is so important.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Because I think it's generally a new concept for most people to be operating with other people.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:54.000
This way or other organizations, or organizations to be operating with each other's way, and we default so quickly to who owns what he was, who gets, who gets to make the final decisions on what and we don't

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
even we don't even realize we're doing it right most of the time.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And it's so cool it happens, so quickly, where we just kind of throw up our hands and go well. I don't agree with them, and I'm out of here or right, like which which comes from that seeming that that architecture

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:21.000
of only one person gets to make the decisions in this person's not listening to me. and so my voice isn't being hurt, and so i'm out of here right instead of the I have something to contribute you have something to

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
contribute. we're struggling to contribute something together right and and sometimes this might, you know your thing might take the lead.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
But sometimes my thing might take the lead and it's more about the thing than it is about the people.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And I think that's a lot that's a lot of new stuff for a lot of people.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And you know what I what I've been thinking is an extension from the last 2 to 2 ofm calls, and I had a I had a conversation with Klaus yesterday to to start to shepherd my idea

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
forward. what's interesting. So i'm gonna start with the Meta version of this since that's what we're talking about.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000
But then I wanna get into the details because it's a real real interoperability question, and that's kind of why I wanted to bring it to flotilla.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So first the the bigger stuff. When the idea came to me, I realized for me it really helped me see what Meta is doing is is trying to figure out what and what the process is by which people collaborate together right figuring out what

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
the solvents are as part of that process when someone brings something forward and gives a presentation, says this is what i'm doing.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000
This is my project. What happens after that becomes becomes a new process.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000
How do we include these people into the larger community what's the response of the larger community to this person?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
What's our responsibility to reacting to that person do we provide support?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
What is it that they need? Do we try to match them?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000
All of that becomes a new process that you might say if you if you threw forward the idea like, Okay, let's make a business plan.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Or, okay, let's make a marketing you know marketing plan.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
There are plenty of people in the world who know what that is, what that looks like, how to do it.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Kinds of tasks and people and skills we need in the room in order to make that happen.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
But when we say, how do we work collaboratively?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Everybody goes I there's a lot of stuff we've been talking about it for years, and we're still not sure what the process is.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And so to me that's the experiment of Meta as a whole Meta project.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Little little M. little P. is operationalizing. You put that word in Jonathan and the chat.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I like that right operationalizing creating the process by which we understand this, and once we get it to something that's a slightly repeatable like it, almost like It's a new scientific method right.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
We've got to practice it, and then go Oh, no this is working.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
This is, makes sense to other people. Other people can replicate this, and they can use it in other places.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:52.000
But right now we we I realized we need experiments to run through like if we come up with some semblance of a due process, It's almost like we need an experiment to run through the process to see if the process works and so

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
that's kind of what had come to me out of the last Ogm.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Call a week ago. Thursday was class had been so he's on so much research in the area of regenerative agriculture.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:10.000
He's so clear about what where the edges where the edge of need is, and where the leading questions are, and where that I realized.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Oh, actually it just it! It sparked. The idea of that could be a great experiment.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And then what would that experiment look like? was what I started to play with?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And how could how could say Klaus? as the focus and Ogm and met a project, and some other things start to work together, to to as as one just one idea, advance, regener of agriculture just a little

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:49.000
bit. So I did a flow, and I posted that to matter most, and I under the Ogm calls, and I talked about it a little bit yesterday, and then class, and I followed up with a meeting, and which was great right so in my mind I'm.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Starting i'm gonna probably end up with another flow i'm still letting it percolate.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:59.000
But what i'm already seeing that's really related to flotilla is, he could really use he really it's not him right.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:13.000
It's regenerative agriculture needs to just like Meta projects, Not Jordan. right? I would regener agriculture needs to be a more of a thing in the world, and where what what what classes research has

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
shown him is the leading edge of a lot of the friction is an education.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I was just not getting out to people what they need to know.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And so we talked a lot about that. but we also talked about some infrastructure.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000
We talked about some branding. We talked about how to create action, you know, in people, which is which is part communication and part education.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:38.000
But it can be some other things, too. We talked about some governance. Peach had a huge idea around the Government kind of a governance piece of it.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000
So it spoke to me again. Okay, validation, that this is a good opportunity to maybe practice.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:15:00.000
If we say just even in this group, right went okay, if Regina ragged culture just happened to be the topic, what would Jonathan do with seriously right to help map or research or codify or coalesce stuff that's

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
already known. Maybe we do, and right like that could go its own.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:14.000
That could be a whole whole little thing. What would Michael contribute to that in terms of not only factor streams, but his experience with branding and right, Whatever his network could bring to bear?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:24.000
What could vincent do in terms of place a repository for people to start coming together and engaging on the material that we're that we're generating, I mean i'm just throwing these things out right and then

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
there'd be like, How do we get all that to come together?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Right, and that How do we get it all to come together to me?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Is meta right is meta project little little little p that's the how, How do we provide a process by which these things are woven?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And so I was very clear with class I said if my idea will works that that it only works well.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
If it doesn't add more work to klaus so it's not like Cloud comes in and gives a presentation.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Then we all throw this stuff at him. and he has to figure it out that's that's good.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:07.000
If people are looking for input and research and all that kind of stuff, but it's It's about another group going away doing their own thinking about it in focused on that particular topic or need and then meta working to weave it

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.000
to sense, make it to hack, codify it some, and to create some bridges, you know, pushing for the interoperability piece a little bit more.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Not just between people, but also through infrastructure and and technology.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:33.000
So that Cloud Lous is supported not it's not a brain dump onto class right that we that we lift him up and say, Oh, you're working with Cr club and you're trying to get them to to market this information out

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
to their entire network. But you've been stuck there for 3 years?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Because what if the the group came together, and and one of the ideas that was born was either a new content written in new ways, or some videos got made or right like just proposing that stuff back to him and him getting to pick this is good this is

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
good. This is good. I think these are the right, and then it becomes a collaborative thing.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Maybe it lasts a couple of weeks, Maybe it lasts a couple of months. That's up to the people anyway.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:11.000
So up to me. it's more about the flow more about the process So that's my that's my thought which speaks both to what is Meta Project and how can flotilla help and trying to action.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000
You know, create collaborative action,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I I like it. and I have some stories to tell

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:35.000
So so there's enough stuff on I I was wondering if we would just take notes in chat.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:45.000
But there's enough stuff that I started to hack in day. so let me

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Let me share my screen and and then show the hack.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Md.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Kind of torn i've got a bunch of windows up, but I don't think you can see anything like embarrassing.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
I was shopping for fidget toys on lax Best earlier today.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Which I find embarrassing to share but but I don't think you can see them so So So I let's see.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:43.000
So. let me share this first, and to share this I make right everyone, and then I copy that, and then I find the Zoom chat.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Not that everybody has to participate on this, but

00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:03.000
But there's enough stuff floating that okay so So for topics.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:11.000
We've got comparing contrast

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:27.000
I'm gonna add actually, maybe Maybe not I don't know if that belongs in there.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And wendy What would you say? the how would you have what's the name that you would give the the idea that you've got for helping class.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:55.000
How you see you muted wendy you're muted

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
It's when you needed for everybody else sorry by that yeah.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
So the flow i'm calling the flow of for collaborative action.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
I mean maybe it's like the meta project process you know or something.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
But I feel like that's 2 meta and it's really a flow.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:20.000
We're working again outside and inside of met it's really not specific Say that again.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:47.000
So far collaborative action. and maybe if you don't mind capital f coupla and starting yeah and regenerative egg gang

00:20:47.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Okay. So

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:11.000
So I i'd like this and I see it differently. so I I guess i'm gonna jump back a bit to this topic.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000
But then we'll come back and talk about regenerating the culture

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:30.000
So

00:21:30.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Experiment,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
So so I think, you know, we could look around. We could look through the past.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:14.000
We could look around now, we could say these people are working for as as part of the Meta project. right?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:27.000
So Cloud is essentially generic meta project because he's working on the thing that's how Jordan says it.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
The highest purpose of you know everyone, or something like that.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000
So just generically he's working in a meta-project way.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000
I think a suggestion I have, I guess, a a way that I kind of think about.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Why we would Have a capitalized meta project and this is this kind of is something that anybody can also borrow without really understanding what they're doing.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Right you know, hey? I'm in africa and i'm working on water wells and growing trees.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And you know Hashtag met a project. Oh, And can I just interject for a second I I flipped the terms.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
I think, which is also interesting to me. The capital capital P.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Is the version that can't be defined right yeah let's let's keep talking through that because you know.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Obviously, if I want a Hashtag Meta project and i've never heard of Meta Project.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
I've never heard of lions very kind of in Africa working on water walls and trees .

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:42.000
I'm probably gonna capitalize it I use it as passionate Yeah, I mean to me it's like those those things that are

00:23:42.000 --> 00:24:02.000
These are some of the other circles, that I that I run in. but like if you're spirit versus spirit, the the capital S is the one that, like all like all is one where it gets gets capitalized , the way

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:17.000
i'm thinking i and i'm thinking of it differently like the generic one I would lurk, and then the specific one on it would uppercase capitalize, because this is less work and this is more work if that makes

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
sense it's like you you're making maybe even maybe even them at a project, or something like that.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:37.000
So so, anyway. another thing, another exhibit I have for this is there's the Meta projects zoom room.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Let's look at matter most the way I I like the way I wrote this Peter commenced, is a hashtag meta Project Sovereign, and to the extent that we want to

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:20.000
I I think the difference between a generic

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000
And thanks for blowing this together for me and calling that yet another.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Okay. great.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
I I think what we wanna do and I don't know I don't.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:55.000
I don't know and I don't really care what the name is, but I think we want to say you know if if you want to identify yourself as a Lionsburg meta project sovereign and maybe sovereign is

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
a part of that word, too, or whatever word we want to replace solving with.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:12.000
But so meta Project Sovereigns fall a couple of core principles

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:21.000
And

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:36.000
I think something in the yeah I like it I don't trust my connection, but I related yeah

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:43.000
We need Lansberg meta project needs to Say if you're a Lionsberg meta Project sovereign.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:54.000
There's a few things that you do so and I think it's that you're autonomous sovereign

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:03.000
That you communicate your mission, or something like that.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:10.000
I really think, Michael, your your analogy there to the environmental movement is brilliant. really.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:20.000
I mean it's such an it makes it so much clearer instantly, you know, I think, for people everyone can relate to that.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:27.000
I think the only thing that that meta project does that the environmental movement doesn't. but that's no judgment. there.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
It's just no no one's really I think doing it effectively.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Yet is the collaborative piece there's a potential here to try to bring things together to clickively in a way that say environmental defense, fun.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Sierra Club green piece, like conservation voters aren't Aren't making efforts, and nor do they need to necessarily to collaborate together.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:54.000
I think, in the case of meta project we're making efforts to collaborate together to work towards similar things together.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:01.000
And I think that's Why? the mapping becomes so important because we're looking for where the synergies where we can.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:15.000
We can make our efforts more efficient, right? So if the Environmental Defense Fund was really we Isn't, really born of a of a legal Space and Sierra club which is born of an you know, environmental conservation right and league of

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
conservation voters, which is really, which is in some ways more about more about governance, right?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:30.000
What if those 3 had overlapping pieces, and they were trying to coordinate on the overlapping pieces, so that the system as a whole could benefit from all 3, and not not be?

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Do not duplicate the efforts and right so I hear That's what I hear in the meta projects.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Everyone coming to that space is recognizing we don't need 25 platforms.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:48.000
3 would be wouldn't be an improvement right we don't need 16 different organizations, being funded trying to figure out the new governance.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:58.000
We could probably narrow that down quite a bit and all the funding could be going to to 4 or 5, and or one right, and that's what I hear.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:14.000
That's the difference. But I love, I love the analogy for the for the simplicity of understanding how sovereigns versus a versus the A general, you know a general movement towards something is working and I know that's

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:21.000
why I feel like movement's not quite the right word but it is kind of the right word, and I know we keep dipping into that when we're coming out.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:28.000
We don't have a word i'm gonna risk and rejecting here and see if I can hold my connection.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Yeah, I I almost think that we when you think about the environmental movement where you think about the civil rights movement or you think about, you know the so-called women's movement.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Nobody nobody like, you know. People tried to be primary advocates.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:56.000
People tried to be the most likely talking head, you know. you know.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:12.000
For a while. Jesse Jackson got to be the person who got called on a network, you know, to be a network talking head. More likely than any other one person with regard to the civil rights.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Okay, , Okay, But I mean that didn't make him the president of anything, or give him any power , and

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:36.000
And the idea that we're gonna be more efficient like the environment. Would the environmental movement be more efficient if there was some coordinating force that said, Okay, Edf, you do this and see our club.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Beauty that you do that, sure, but that's never gonna happen. and so to recognize that the and control of But we we can up for connections that are let it recognize itself in the way the environmental movement does or the full rights movement does as

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:18.000
a movement to the global thing. I was half-poking, saying: The Lionsburg Fund for advancement of the Meta Project is just a way to recognize if you substitute work, environment there or environmental movement or

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:31.000
civil rights It's like it's thing That's trying to recognize who's already doing stuff to like support them more than administrative over them.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Not like point them to you right you know so it's It's a funny line to walk because it's not an recognized movement, but struck me as what we're trying to do I love I really

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:58.000
love that, and the branding is so important because it's galvanizing right, and I I know every time I've used the word Meta project.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
People are like. Wait Facebook, right? it's been and now It's been stolen, right? So .

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
I almost wanna do like the movement toward a better verse, right or so.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Get away from that. A project because it's from a branding perspective it's It's really a good choice anymore.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Unfortunately and I I agree with you, too, I I like oh, i'm sorry you're trying to see some.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Oh, I was just gonna say I I appreciate the fact that the start, you know.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Jordan bracket meta project and you know as as like he knew he was talking about something that Wasn't really called that wasn't branding. and you know it is it is gonna be a challenge to figure

00:32:44.000 --> 00:33:01.000
out. but the hashtag is that every is gonna understand the way they understand Black Lives matter or me, too, or you know whatever it is as as we're all we're all pushing this you know reader good agenda

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.000
maybe it's hashtag greater good yeah i'm from some other, some other term.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
You know some other implications and inferences that I would stare away from.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
But yes, your your point I think we're making this is similar right?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Is that a different name would be wise, not quite sure what it would be.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:36.000
And before we get into really pushing this name. out. to a bunch of places, it probably would be wise to consider it again, and I did notice Jordan's point at 1 point he was like a lot of money went into this name

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:53.000
which I didn't realize right and so that, or at a project, if if he meant Lionsburg

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Meta project because because of what we were just talking about and I liked. I didn't know you were doing it tongue and cheek.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:07.000
I like the lines word fun for advancement of the Meta Project, or advancement of the better versus greater good, or whatever we want to call it, or whatever ends up.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Being called you know, I think, is is actually nice, because to me I always, you know.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:22.000
To me the funding is one piece it's not everything right and so putting them together is on call is a little uncomfortable for me.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:36.000
I'll admit any any more than I would say factor Meta project, or I mean, this is what we're talking about today, right or seriously, Project or catalyst meta Project

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Hi! thanks, Michael. I I I agree met meta project is kind of like the environmental movement, or meta movement, or whatever and i'm not crazy about the name, either.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
I i'm not sure that we're going to find a great name that's good for everything.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Maybe both names kind of is you. You pick you pick a name that you can stick with, and and, like Amazon, was never a good name for a bookstore or a you know, dry goods store.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Ebay was never a good name for an auction house.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:20.000
You just pick a a name, that's distinctive and doesn't offend anybody too much, and then you keep double down doubling down on what that means.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
And and after a while, you know it it becomes obvious by that.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:32.000
A a story, by the way. the founder of Linkedin was an angel investor in my company social text.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000
And so he was talking about this new early early early on I have this new thing.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
It's gonna be a network of all everybody's business contacts and stuff like that.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
And then it's gonna be called linkedin and i'm like linked in that's the dumbest name.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:55.000
I cannot even imagine why you would name it. that and it sounds like link and tin together, and it's like I was smart enough thankfully.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
I was smart enough not to say anything i'd like learned my lesson by complaining about names Prior to that.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000
So now, if you say, Linkedin, everybody knows like that what it means right, and I I was totally wrong, and guessing that it was a stupid name.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:15.000
It's not necessarily a great name but it has become genericized to the point where you know what Linkedin is.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:23.000
If you're in business, and you know that's that's the that's what happened I I don't wouldn't mind meta it's to me it's more that it's I have to

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:37.000
keep making a caveat with with Facebook Now that's the only that's that's a good thing. Bad thing, you know. It's a good news bad news kind of thing the the people i've learned naming stuff

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
from I I worked with a brilliant marketing Vp.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Of marketing on another startup and we picked yipes as a name for an Internet company Internet infrastructure company broadband company.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
And he's like, okay here's the way it works you pick something that like startles people and gets their attention.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:09.000
And then then you've won a big chunk of the battle for their you know attention and mind space, the The work that you have to do is then to fill in.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:20.000
You know the conversation after that? right? So I I think my my friend Ron might argue that Meta is actually a really good thing to choose, even though Facebook hijacked it.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Because it, you know it sticks in people's minds So the first conversation is, you know, Oh, you guys are working with.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Facebook And so then we say no. And then the next part of the conversation is, Oh, you're the people that named yourself.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
After Facebook. What do you do again? you know and and it's a pretty good hook that way?

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Comments that Michael and jonathan are putting in chat about, you know, making it nonsense names. I mean I mean what I've learned from people in my sphere is my personal spheres who are brand you

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
know our brand experts are the just echoing but That's true, right.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
A nonsense word is better. you can make it mean something.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:18.000
But that's not I mean that's not somebody came to my civilization and said, Hey, I don't want you to own the word civilization, too.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
I know

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:32.000
So there's even that kind of friction I I I wanted to come back to a point.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Brad has his hand up to you just pointing out and I've been trying to just sort of monitor here, but in a little distracted as someone who's coming who's fairly fresh to you know this

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.000
whole conversation. yeah, that all makes sense. I mean to me Lionsberg is actually problematic.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:04.000
I don't know if that's even at issue here, but that it just has the wrong ring to me.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
But can you worry that's a that's just my 2 cents.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:21.000
For me. Meta Project. is it is a little too generic for my purpose, for what I although it is descriptive of what what what it is.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
So I mean I think there's a lot of value in that.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:38.000
But, anyway, branding is always fun. but anyway, I mean it was just gonna say that on you i'll have to say goodbye in about 10 min.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
I think i've got 3 different things now to talk about

00:39:43.000 --> 00:40:00.000
So one of them is if it's okay i'll share my screen again and let me know if it's not one of them is the way I think of the non generic meta project sovereigns we want to

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:20.000
say, if you're a you know hashtag the meta project capital sovereign, or maybe it's if you're a Lionsberg meta Project sovereign your autonomous and your your

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
your coordinating with other meta-projecturens.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:39.000
And so that means that you communicate about your mission in your project you're willing to be indirecties

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:49.000
And that you are able to make make commitments and attempt to keep them.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:57.000
And another another thing that you could add to this list:

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Is that you believe in the principles that meta project has and I think that's one that we don't want to add counterintuitively.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:15.000
I agree with that. And, Brad, Do you have your hand up from before, or something new?

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Sorry. Just forgot her. Lower my my arms getting tired. Okay.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Cool. So so the the difference between for me the difference between Lionsburg the Meta project and Edf are see our club and repeat, and whatever is that we're trying to invent or instantiate actually for me it's

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:57.000
replicate nature by having sovereigns, and having them be autonomous, and having them coordinate and teaching people how that happens, and then, having sovereigns that make commitments to each other that whole structure

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:07.000
is something that that we believe is going to be able to Bootstrap to be much bigger than the Sierra Club, but much bigger than Greenpeace, and much bigger than Black Lives.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Matter, and much bigger than, and and this is for me this is the the Lionsberg. The I guess there's maybe 2 parts of it. 1 one part of Lionsburg for me is Jordan's ability to keep saying

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:29.000
on the and we're all working towards the higher purpose a higher goal to you know, there's one project it's not like we're you know, a 100 projects or a 1,000 projects or a 1 million projects.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:40.000
We're all working on one lower case meta project and Then the the only way that you get that done is by having a ton with servants coordinating

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:53.000
So that's one thing I wanted to to convey another thing is, where's what we're starting to do? is is enumerate the things that we need to name So there's a name for the overall movement

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:02.000
there's a name for the focusing group that says these are the things that we need to work on together. that are a part of the magic project.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:17.000
So this for me is kind of lionsburg and maybe another one is another thing that we need to name is the kind of sovereign that's working on and there's probably like 6 or 8 of these and so part of part of

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:26.000
our challenge is when we're talking about Lionsberg or meta project or sovereigns, or something like that, where we're actually trying to name a number of things.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:40.000
And I think if we work to figure, out what the things are that we're trying to name and differentiate them from each other, then we can name them more effectively, can I just interject the group that prioritizes.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:47.000
I would say, is part of the meta project not part of Lionsburg.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:44:05.000
I didn't say prioritize Oh, public size i'm. Sorry i'm reading small type prioritization So what do you mean by identify then?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:21.000
This for me is This for me is the mosaic and tiles thing that that I have borrowed from Jerry and have I tried to give to Jordan and Jordan

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:35.000
likes it and make sense. So identifying, you know. So so one obvious tile is is helping people understand sovereigns, and the way to coordinate. Ha!

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Ha the wake sovereigns, another there's a whole bunch of these, you know.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:49.000
The sdks are kind of in. this the Sdgs form a imperfect mosaic and imperfect set of tiles.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
So there's a bunch of core things so tapestry is also in here, too, Right?

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:01.000
I don't know how if I would put I don't know if tapestry is okay a separate case.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:08.000
I don't know yeah either, uppercase but that's fine .

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:38.000
So, even

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
So even you know we we've had trouble or I don't know trouble.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:46:01.000
So not the right word. but you know there are things things we're trying to figure out whether it goes in this bucket, or whether it doesn't go in this bucket.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:13.000
So i've i've kind of made the assertion that the directory of all the projects isn't part of this. it's actually sovereigns that work.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
That. So Lionsberg is gonna say, Okay, we have to have directories.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
But Lionsberg shouldn't be the organization that that creates the directories right.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:34.000
It should say there's a need for directories and then catalyst, and whatever else comes into that

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000
So then, another thing I wanted to talk about was regenerative.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Agriculture and cloud. is it Okay, If I go there

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Yeah, no Sorry i'm still i'm still working on that this little addition here.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:04.000
So yeah, i'm like they're there needs to be a group that helps prior, you know.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Again i'm i'm coming from the assumption now that Meta project is a little more more about the process, and then mortar between the tiles.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Right so and that the tiles will will surface.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:31.000
They either already exist and will become well we'll be interested in collaboration, or they will surface right and become become sovereigns, and then get woven in or glued down. in the case of the mosaic right And

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:49.000
So there needs to be a group that helps prioritize what the collaborative effort will focus on

00:47:49.000 --> 00:48:02.000
And I guess i'll use collaborative action just sense to start repeating that that's that's an open question for me, and there's a to to connect publicize and prioritize.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:14.000
So by by my thinking you can't you can't really prioritize a ton of sovereigns they're going to pick their own priorities.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:27.000
So what you do is you say that you you can publicize the fact that social justice is more important than climate change or vice versa, or whatever right you can.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
You can publicize. Here are the problems, and here are the things that need fixing.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:38.000
And here are the efforts we've identified that could help fix that , and there's a there's a kind of prioritization there.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:57.000
But it's a software. organization. it's a it's a it's talking about the need for it and comparing it with the other needs, but not, I guess I guess it I I wanna caution us that prioritize is like a

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:06.000
project management term that it's like Okay, Well, I have declared that we're going to do these things first, and we're not going to do these these other things.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:18.000
You know until we get the first one done and I know That's not what you mean, but , it's easy , but it is sort of in there in that right like even when we're talking about map weavers we're talking

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000
about. you know we're now starting to talk about Okay, here are the projects towards achieving something right?

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:36.000
So the collaboration to a certain degree. I think inside of sovereign, and even between sovereigns there's definitely going to be prioritization right right and what I'm saying is there is some collaborative

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:48.000
effort. all the you know at the at the between and that there's sense making that needs to happen there right, and I so I think your your term of soft prioritization is is good.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:55.000
I I don't think just identifying it is enough and They do think it needs to go like one inch .

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:03.000
More than that, right? And so i'm Not sure We have a word right, of just going, hey?

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Everyone we're noticing that if this comes first it'll help a lot of other things right.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:15.000
So so, even though that's not hey? your sovereigns thing, we're just bringing attention to the fact that if this comes first.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:26.000
So if people are inclined paying attention to this would be good right and then it happens, or doesn't have a can't make people the same way that i'm proposing the regenerative agriculture thing comes

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:43.000
out like i'm. i'm noticing that that is more ready for collaboration than maybe some other initiatives that are already working in the works, and it therefore it i'm suggesting that it become a focus for a

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:51.000
while as a way to experiment, and also as a way to help someone do the work in their sovereign bubble.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000
That will help all of us in turn right it's one of those more urgent ones.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:02.000
And it's one of the more ready ones so it rises to the surface, not puts it first to your point right?

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000
? So how do we surface those things? and maybe that's a better way to say it? right?

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:21.000
How do we surface the things that are ready now there needs to be a group focused on that? And the surfacing on the seeing the whole of what all the sovereigns are doing? not who don't have necessarily a a bone to pick or

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:33.000
a or that's the wrong way to say it like a an attachment to that's better way to say it like an attachment to one particular sovereign when they're thinking about the collaborative and the the weaving and the

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:47.000
more between everything,

00:51:47.000 --> 00:52:07.000
You know, put like suggested focus like it's not Yeah, a suggestion, not the that's that's often it already a bit. That's kind of why to me Lionsburg is is separate from Meta project right?

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Because to me Lionsburg comes, has a role to play relative to the to the channeling.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:26.000
If I understand right channeling, a funding governance structures right the same way that other groups will have a role to play and the larger mosaic right?

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000
I don't see lionsburg being the mosaic.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:45.000
I see Linesburg being one tile i'm gonna talk about clouds for and and then the I ideas around flow for collaborative action.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:50.000
For a few minutes, and then i'll yield the floor.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000
I want to hear about vincent and Jonathan's work.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:01.000
I wanted to. I wanted to note there was a beginning of a sovereign called community food systems.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:08.000
That and Panicus and I and class a little bit worked on pretty hard.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000
For we put a lot of effort into it.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
I put a lot of effort into it, and So did Anne.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:37.000
It. It zombies back probably in December and to go forward properly.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.000
We'd want to go backwards a little bit and talk about this

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000
So I i'm super super interested in regeneration called friends.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.000
So health and stuff like that from a kind of a collaborative flow perspective.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Not not so much a subject matter perspective. but this is one of the things that I identified along with everybody else that and and Klaus as a as a lead in that.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:24.000
And we we put a lot of effort into it. and it and it stalled hard. to the extent that Sam was, you know, one of the people working with us hard and he's like what the fat guy is you know I i'm i'm projecting a little bit he's

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000
like, he said very nicely, Hey, is there anything going on with this group?

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.000
And Cloud said, You know, Hey, there's stuff you know there's still energy, but this group is quiet.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:43.000
So So I wanna talk more about that and then I think kind of generically.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:53.000
I'd like wendy your your focus on folk for collaborative action here, and from my sovereign point of view.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:59.000
It's right that you Don't wanna put a bunch of resources on class.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:04.000
And say, Okay, Cloud, figure out the the way to connect all these resources and activate them.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.000
That's correct. I think what you do want is for there to be.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000
I I think you want to spin up a sovereign.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000
And then the sovereign wants to decide very proactively.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Very directive very directly here's the things that we're doing right

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:31.000
And so Klaus could be the leader of that sovereign or one of the leaders over that sovereign community.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Food systems was set up, so that Anne was the leader of the sovereign, and at least to my understanding. Anne was the leader of the sovereign, and Klaus was the way I I was thinking of it, and with the CEO

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000
arts, c. oo and class was the CEO

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:57.000
The face of the sovereign and the the person generating the drive, and the effort and stuff like port or publicizing, mostly like making the effort happen.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:12.000
But Anne was really the driver of it. So I think, without the the way that you get clarative action is a a sovereign with a leadership.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Leadership and focus driving that action. So unless you have that, unless you have a focus and one or a group of people who have decided to lead the effort, nothing happens Right?

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:33.000
You can contribute a lot of stuff. So So the good news is we had that for community food systems.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000
In, and the bad news is it still didn't work for various reasons.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:47.000
We could talk about some other time. Yes, and i'm picturing it a little bit differently.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:57.000
In my mind. i've already i've already. made some assumptions that have not been talked about just so.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:06.000
I can move forward in my own head. and one of those assumptions is that the sovereigns will organize themselves around the round.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:13.000
Sectors right of of either Metas choosing, or we pick a set or something like that.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Right, and part of the reason why i'm doing that in my own head is because we need a way to organize how people see themselves in, you know, in terms of the work kind of work they're doing and this you know is the

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000
conversations of a tapestry, or about any sort of the mapping.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:36.000
There needs to be a way to congregate some things and slice and dice it in different ways to congregate things in different ways, to see where the synergies are.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:49.000
I think, when assuming we wave the magic wand and that happens right then people will see themselves in as being associated with particular areas, whether it's governance or it's you know arts.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Or it's right so again, waving a magic one Let's assume people see themselves.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:11.000
Then, when worse, when when Meta project says hey we would like to help, we're seeing the emergence of a need both from a timing perspective and also an interest perspective and a readiness perspective that rejecter of agriculture could use some

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:19.000
help. right. let's say it, says that and from an initial meeting with Klaus and a couple of other people in the field.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:27.000
We see that this request for guidance is needed and we're putting out a request specific could be to all the sectors, or could be the specific.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:34.000
We're putting out a request for guidance from and the environment sector, the governance sector, the education sector and the art sector.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:44.000
And we would like people who are willing and wanting to come forward from those sectors to have a conversation about it right, and see what we can do to help support Klaus right?

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:52.000
So already. they're choosing but it's it gives us a framework to ask for asking without like It's really just those people in those sectors so the sector itself.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Doesn't have to be a sovereign because inside the sectors.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.000
There are already sovereigns or just interested people who don't have to make a sovereign in order to take part.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Right. So people come together right so it could be tons of individuals too.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:15.000
We're just ready to mobilize on something or want to jump into another sovereign in order to just jump into this project because they're organized around a sector.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:28.000
They recognize themselves, and can say, oh, here's where I can contribute now we're aimed towards something they have a conversation, and in amongst themselves they can start proposing different things, and again then it becomes meta to

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:34.000
curate, all of that help to create some sense out of it and do a proposal back to the community.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000
This is what we're seeing this is how we're seeing it work together.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:45.000
This is how we're seeing it help class who's in like who actually wants to take action now on these things, And you're gonna have some fall off and people right?

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.000
Pick up some pieces, and then either it's enough to move something forward or at fault.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:59.000
You know it falls apart there, and it either. which would tell me it's not timing yet, or right So to me the structure that we're trying to create, and the mapping is enough.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I'm not sure that we need different sovereigns for that structure.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.000
However, the sovereigns themselves, either as individuals or as groups, need to then could be.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:21.000
The commit, you know, be a commitment. We may find it 1 point that Meta itself has kind of like a a organizing sovereign around environment that helps to coales just for environment.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000
But right now I'm seeing it that we just need a collaborative effort around Meta itself.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000
But I could see that fractaling out as well, so that environment does the same thing.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
They have people coming that just have issues inside environment sector.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Whatever we want to name it right, and then that they have their own kind of hub for that, and only does it do.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000
They raise issues up when they need collaboration across all the sectors up to the metal level.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000
And so in that sense there's a little bit of hierarchy. and there's but there's most definitely the sovereigns.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And and that's why I think this process is just a little bit different than anything I've seen or experienced

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Do you wanna respond Pete, or why don't you go first?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Okay, . Are you welcome? So Flow is mentioned earlier.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And it occurs to me that with the meta project can provide in addition to everything we've been talking about is identifying how sovereign day is feeding their results to sovereign b and that it isn't a

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:41.000
hierarchy thing that's a agreement and negotiated agreement between Sovereign A.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:02:04.000
And B and i'm drawing attention. to the notion of identifying opportunities for doing that and match making and stewarding a conversation that mixed concrete.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:24.000
A deliverable This is this: prevents, or for aids the process of how do you say collaboration as a whole?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Which I I think is, is in the spirit of the capital. M.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Capital P. request for guidance

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Sovers have a tendency to work in isolation as a silo. And I think this is a good thing, because focus is important.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:03:02.000
But knowing how my little silo piece gets into the bigger thing, can often be very invigorating.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I have a purpose. I i'm doing this for sovereign D.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:23.000
And i'm helping them and doing what i'm doing so , 2 cents

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I I Wendy, I I really liked your explanation

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:41.000
And i'm not sure completely agree. but I definitely want to keep the conversation going, because I think it's super generative.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:55.000
And I I I I don't know if we're saying the same thing a different way, or if we're seeing different things, and and I want to keep figuring it out the I think you're describing one of

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:20.000
the different patterns that that I think would work where people people in sovereigns inceptors kind of get their attention brought to a a little bit more of a focus need and and then maybe maybe in my language, and then

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
we see if it can spin up the sovereign if There's enough energy to spin up the sovereign the

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I I think that's a good pattern and the pattern that I see, and another pattern that I see is is the kind of the complement of that or the inverse of that where a few people identify need and and start the

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:53.000
sovereign and the sovereign spins up from those people rather than kind of spinning out of.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
You know the collection of other sovereigns and and people.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:11.000
You start with a very focused sovereign. for example, you might be talking to Klaus and Klaus is talking about Bend, Oregon and Southern California, and this little farm.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
That he knows in aptos near santa Cruz, and you're going.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I've got family in santa cruz and I know I know that area.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
That farm in Aptos. What do you think they need?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:41.000
You know, and coming down to a really specific project that happens to be in a sector is the way that I see 6 is is is the most powerful way that I've seen sovereigns to come into being a few people get together.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
About something that's very focused and they're super passionate about.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
And then they don't have everything they need to accomplish it.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:06:01.000
But and and that's when they reach out to the you know reasonable to the network. and say, Hey, we've got this focus and vision.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:06.000
5 years from now this farm in Aptos is going to be.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:14.000
You know that we will have turned contaminated soil into super rich and fertile soil will be growing these kinds of vegetables.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Yada yada we've got it got the idea of what's gonna happen.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:31.000
And it's very focused right any yeah sure it's in the the it's in the sectors over regenerative health. and you know food equity or whatever But I don't really care about that what I really care about is this

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:37.000
problem and making it happen right. But I don't know how to market the thing and and hey, network!

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I need help marketing or hey network. I need help funding a common one, or hey, network.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
It turns out that there's this mechanical thing that we think is super easy to do.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:56.000
But we have no way to figure out how to do it or we've we've tried to you know we've tried to do the mechanic mechanical engineering of it, and we've completely failed hey?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Network. Can you help us with this pump system that we think is going to be the key to you, know, making life green again, or whatever. right?

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:22.000
So there's the the the pattern you discuss come. It seems like it comes from outside in kind of and then another pattern is from right inside with one or 2 or 3 people talking about their should be you know and grows out

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:37.000
from there, and that i'm not I I wouldn't say that either one of them is better or worse, and I like both of them actually, but the one that has more focus and more autonomy, and more drive the the thing that

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:44.000
you want is Probably most of us here have have experienced that thing where you wake up in the morning you go.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Thank God, i've found this project. or thank God I found them resources to do this project, because this is the thing that I am most passionate in the world about, and i'm just going to do this whether or not you know I would be

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:07.000
doing this, you know, even I I am doing this even though i'm not getting paid right, or or I would thank God i'm getting paid for this, because this is the thing I would be doing you know you you need that you need that hyper

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000
drive about a particular thing right? for instance, for me, one of the things in my life is massive. wiki right?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I wake up every day going thank God bill's helping me on massive wiki, because I would otherwise I would be doing it by myself.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I'm going to be doing massive wiki for a while, because it's the most important thing I think is in the world right when I'm not doing other things.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:41.000
But but anyway, you really need that drive and passion, somehow I guess I guess you end up in the situation where I guess maybe where i'm coming to.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
And finally, thanks for listening to me while I was doing it.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:52.000
If you go outside in, you still end up meeting a small group of people who are passionate about a project.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:59.000
A particular project, right? and and I apply that in different ways.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:21.000
If you can. Bootstrap your way into that right If if you see that there's yeah, I I kind of can explain what i'm thinking, Klaus is an interesting example of where I got involved in

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:28.000
community food systems, what ended up being called community food systems. That was a name that we came to after a whole naming exercise.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I got involved in community community food systems because it was meeting after meeting where a cloud would would say these amazingly, you know dramatic and intense things, you know, like in food is gonna collapse in 20 or 30 years you know, my great

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
grand. my grandkids, my great grandkids are gonna be starving right?

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:58.000
And that's like galvanizing after you know the fourth or fifth, or tenth time I heard Cloud say that in calls.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.000
It was like we need to get class some help because you know I'm.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Not a food expert, but I've heard enough from cloud to know that this needs to be done.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Let's figure out how to hook up clouds with the right stuff right?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:25.000
And so we spun together a sovereign that was focused on particular parts of operationalizing solutions to classes, observations that you know.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000
So it it until you get that crystallized few people who are going.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
This is the most important thing i'm i'm gonna work on this, you know.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Full time. for the next 6 months or the next few years or whatever until it's, you know, until it's not until enough other people's hair is on fire that I don't have to be the one pulling for it

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
right that's we we need to get to that for every sovereign.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Basically. Yeah, my, my only I agree with all of that. And so I just tried to capture it.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And hack. and Dean, I think, Jonathan, it was you that was hopping type in there, too, without you.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Yeah, So we just try to capture all of that.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:15.000
And and I like how you phrased it to it's like the outside in versus the inside out it's kind of almost like top down versus bottom up.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:27.000
You know, a little bit too a little yeah and not in a bad way. No, no, in a beautiful way. I really like I really like how we just kind of tease that apart in our conversation today, because I think that's really

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:40.000
important to understand that both processes are happening and they're probably happening at the same time, too, and I don't wanna lose one little thread that really hasn't come up and Well, it a little bit.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000
It hasn't I just wanna kind of like really bring it to the 4, which is the individual right?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Not so much a group right? and when we talk about spinning up sovereigns, I think that's really healthy for groups that are starting to work together around something, even if it's you know right at the seeds you know

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000
it sooner is better kind of if it really feels like it has momentum, and and it's really galvanizing.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:14.000
But there's so many opportunities for individuals to come in and go out of things, and life happens to right that that, making sure that whatever processes we're talking about allow for the individual in and out to that we're not so

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:25.000
focused on creating sovereigns all the time that we or feel such a need to create a sovereign every time There's a little bit of a little bit of momentum that the individuals are like let's I didn't mean that kind

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:36.000
of commitment like they back off or they feel like now. There's a lot of friction to just getting to just doing a a a few things like we're just gonna go to the beach. this weekend and clean up the garbage right do

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
we need a sovereign for that right so it's it's that kind of thing to me now.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:49.000
There might be a sovereign around that that's organizing beach cleaning for everything, or it could just be somebody who lives near the beach who wants to go pick up some you know and catches up with a few friends to do

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.000
it. I want to leave space for both. Is that another? This is another super important conversation.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Because so So one thing into that is that i'm pretty sure I've made it feel and other people have made it feel like sovereign is like a big grand thing right? an individual can be a sovereign

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:30.000
and the you know, and a sovereign is just saying i'm going to commit, I guess a meta project solver for me. is that ability to work the ability to make a commitment right?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:36.000
So the the the recordings for the Meta project.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Wednesday calls were being posted, and we needed to refer to them.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:52.000
And so not only did I raise my hand and bug Jordan about it, but I I also kind of committed at least to myself, you know. Hey, I?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
At some point, I said, Hey, Jordan if it's you know if you're too busy to do it.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I'll do it and in in so doing I I didn't think in my mind i'll do this one, but then i'm out of here.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:15.000
It was I'll do this one and i'm going to keep doing it for a while, or at least until somebody else takes over and thanks Vincent for for helping take over or or supplement I'm gonna keep doing it

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:28.000
So when I say sovereign and this isn't clear yet it's like i'm going to do this, and I actually have a little conference a little bit of a commitment right So i'm gonna clean up the beach

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:34.000
today, and i'll also commit to myself at least to to clean it up next September as well right.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.000
So not that sovereigns have to make that commitment.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
But imagine project sovereign. You start to need to to, you know.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I think the the other thing I i'm a little bit torn about

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:07.000
We had A. We had a situation recently where and in individual just wanted to help out.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:24.000
And and meta Project failed them because it didn't Matter project didn't make it obvious you know how to structure the help, how to reach out to others to see if that help was needed, or if it was another kind of help or

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:35.000
what right? And in reflecting on that failure, this one of the things to me is, and I kind of said this on the Wednesday call

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:42.000
We we have a may and maybe it's our culture we have a problem where it's really easy for people to get into their own head.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:53.000
And and get super far in investing time and energy into an idea without reaching out for some triangulation with other people.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:04.000
So I I hear I have my friend Bill who is like hey? But what about me?

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
I don't I don't want to be a sovereign.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.000
I just wanna help, and I wanna help where it's helpful and I wanna know how to help

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:21.000
So I I get that there's a a danger to me of

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:37.000
A solution which I don't like completely but a solution, that that I think, addresses some of the concerns that I saw for unaffiliated individuals being tempted to be in their own head too much and do too much work that

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:43.000
isn't helpful to the network a solution that I thought of is hey?

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:56.000
If if you're an unaffiliated person I think the sovereignty in the federation, or the the sovereigns and federation thing is so important for people to learn it's like if you're not part

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:05.000
of the sovereign. Maybe what you should do is join up with a couple of other people to be a sovereign, and then that sovereign should be the thing that looks for.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Where I can plug in right so if i'm called to to clean up the beach.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.000
This weekend. Maybe what you should do is instead of just doing it yourself.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Talk to at least a couple of other people and say, Hey, can we make this a bigger effort than just me going to the beach right?

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Would you go with me? Is it a good idea which beach should we go to?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.000
So getting that out of one person's head and into 2 or 3 people's heads.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:42.000
I think is a good thing, and i'm not saying that we should never have individuals.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:49.000
But I think it's so important for the network for people to learn to reach out to others.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:58.000
And to start learning that you know we're a sovereign, and we've decided what to do, and you can't tell us what not to do or do what to do.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Together. we've also got a governance process where we decide which beach to go to, and whether it's this weekend or next weekend, and and hopefully one of us would say, Hey, Hey, not only maybe we could also write a blog

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:27.000
post about it, and and you know maybe we can take pictures when we're at the beach and put those in a blog post, and maybe we can get a movement going around cleaning up the beach rather than just I went to the

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:44.000
beach. I cleaned stuff up. it was great which I don't I? I I wanna make sure that that's an okay thing to do, but it it really helps build the Meta project when we think of other people when we start

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:54.000
to co- last, so I wanna make sure that we don't. I guess you know I I I definitely wanna make sure there's balance, but I also want to wait the balance.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I guess I want to tip the balance a little bit towards yeah, you know.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Let's let's think about that let's let's put a pod together to do that we don't have to call this hour.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Let's put you know. but the teaching people the patterns of that, and and encouraging that, and waiting that a little bit heavier than you know.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Just a drive by. I drive by help is great. but you know, think about doing it a little bit more in a in a in a collaboration pattern, in a maybe a collaboration flow to steal your or to borrow your your

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:41.000
phrasing. thanks, really letting me rant that out

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Michael, you're up in the queue no That's Well, not for well.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Yeah,

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:15.000
How about that? , Okay. Oh, well okay, ?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:21.000
We'll we'll go to wendy and and see, yeah, yeah, he's gonna balance come back.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Yes, and because I I I I really wanna advocate for the unseen here, right it's the There's already so much friction, I think, for a lot of people in contributing even an hour of

01:20:49.000 --> 01:21:06.000
their time to something that making to me that the emphasis is, should be on making that as easy as possible, and to create what you're suggesting, which is beautiful and necessary and important.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I think my experience with that is it comes from the modeling of that from the top down, and and right this what we're talking about like making the process deem easy. right.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Once it once it becomes a thing that just everyone. Oh, I would just get what this is which will take some time.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Then it won't even be a question and I think There will always be the very introverted or very busy people, who just the fact that they did it on their own at all.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Is a is a win right? and then there'll be the p which you can't just the mere mention that they have to coordinate with one other person person is enough friction in their mind to not have it happen to people who with just a tiny bit

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.000
of encouragement be like, Oh, my God that's a good idea, and excited to invite 10 more people to come with them.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Right So there's and I think that just there's so much in there in terms of per people's personality.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:06.000
You know what the community they live in, whether they feel connected to those people, whether they are that kind of where they're more extroverted, whether they like organizing, whether they're you know whatever that for some people that's super easy

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
and the mere mention of it is exciting, and the other for other people.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:18.000
That is such a hurdle. for whatever's going on in their lives. And so both and I I personally think there's a bunch of right now the way things are right.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Now there's a bunch of potential, built up and in individuals who who haven't figured out a way yet to collaborate with each other, but are happy to do something even if it's just something in their home right that could

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:42.000
contribute to the overall picture. and Klaus and I were talking about that yesterday, so most of what his idea is trying to reach people at a very, you know, very basic level, not trying to overwhelm them with all the details

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:49.000
about the microbiome, but letting them know that if they just did this one thing it could really help like if everyone just did this one right.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:56.000
And so some of that comes from top down of like everyone should create a victory garden, because then that creates you know 40% of the food production.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000
He's quoted you know came from victory gardens during the war.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:09.000
But you know, and while we don't have that top down kind of emphasis right now I think there are plenty of people, me included.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Be like i'm happy to do. one more thing you you got to tell me what that one more thing is.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I'm not sure what it is you know if i'm gonna redo my kitchen.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:21.000
How how can I do that in a way that is more sustainable, trying to find that information is very hard.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:33.000
So just getting my information to me, or you know what are the distribution channels for that right information alone can can do a lot for for the individual to galvanize a lot create more movement just on the individual level without the need for

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.000
even figuring out what the collaborative or encouraging more collaboration.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Yes, Just to mention Wendy. Alfred has has suggested to me at least that a combination of one more thing and helping us connect instead of just virtually, also a little bit physically, is to do one

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:10.000
more thing. One more very small thing together. so let's let's all find a seed and plant a seed, and then, you know, we can talk about how it's growing or not growing.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Over time right and she's she sees that as a way of essentially, you know, creating a pattern in everybody's head.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:25.000
And then throughout the day that you're participating in this global pattern of all doing a thing together.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And connecting right to me it's like connecting to that bigger story is just as important as connecting to an A.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Another person in that moment. Yeah, it's beautiful yeah Yeah, I I hear the concept crowdsourcing.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:25:01.000
And what you guys are talking about. with the added emphasis on sharing the experience as well as the action which your word pete galvanizes.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:13.000
No Victory garden we're all doing this together. and my brother likes the idea of showing the impact.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Yeah, Okay, you've all done this and here's what that created or the possibility that's emerging sort of like that.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:30.000
So I see multiple phases. And what are you talking about?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:43.000
I I, at the risk of putting a period at the end of this sentence I wanted to request opinions.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:55.000
A different name that captured my attention, which is the word sovereign and

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:03.000
I hear the word group use where the word sovereign probably fits just fine.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.000
And you know, of course I I like the word guild.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:26.000
But I you know I don't have to force that but i'm noticing that it might be there's a There's a possibility that by deciding the sovereign equals Pod equals.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Group, because organization equals project equals guild might be useful.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
So that when we see any of these words we know them mean the same thing.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Because otherwise I mean different things. and i'm not sure that having the mean different things is I think it might be divisive and make us think i'm doing a group and you're doing a sovereign and we

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:26.000
can't expect the same things from each other hey? I I I like that idea, and I I wanna observe that there are different things to name.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:43.000
So one of them, what i've been calling a sovereign is is also what I call a sovereign in the Ogm sense, or a sovereign in the Meta project sense, which, with without without any qualification

01:27:43.000 --> 01:28:00.000
sovereign. just means you're autonomous and you have authority. Absolute authority over over something actually sovereign in the Ogm Meta project sounds for me means that you're willing to be in a directory

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:07.000
and talking about what you're doing, and you have the ability to make commitments

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000
And then and then you'll try to keep them so that's different.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:17.000
So then a group to me, or or another thing to name, I guess maybe so.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I I can work backwards from the names that we've got to the the things that we need to name. that are different.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000
A group is just a a set of people. right?

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:36.000
It. it may not have focus it probably probably doesn't isn't able to make commitments affirmative action.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.000
And then for me a guild is is different.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.000
A guild is, could be a sovereign could be a group.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Bet a guild is doing some internal it's it's more like community of practice where it's during doing some internal teaching and and mentoring about a practice right so sovereign doesn't have to do

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:16.000
that to be effective. a guild probably has governance and a sovereign have governance, but they probably tend to have different governance structures.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:26.000
So there's there are different things to name and we need to figure out how to be clear about naming them differently.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:44.000
And And then I I also agree that when you're talking about one specific thing you you kind of want to use you wanna coalesce around, you know a single phrase or word or whatever that's gonna continue to mean the same

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:53.000
thing to people rather than you know Okay, I think wait you know I think we're doing the same thing, and and yet you're calling it something different. and then.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:58.000
When we go into a meeting together you say one thing i'd say another thing, and then everybody's confused.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:21.000
So that's definitely a thing, and another thing actually is also that as we scale, and especially as we start at different cultures and different languages, we're gonna have to be flexible about flexible and and fast, about

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000
kind of negotiating. Okay, what are you guys talking about?

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:33.000
What are we talking about? we've been using this different language you know, should we continue to use the 2 terms, even though they, you know, mean the same thing?

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Should we coalesce onto one term in a different language?

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:47.000
You know all that kind of stuff reminds me a little bit of Marianne Marianne, on the Wednesday call talked about you know.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Oh, we're gonna have a trust manifesto maybe right and i'm like, well, maybe we're going to have 3 or 6 trust manifestos and depending on which language and culture and history that you've got you would

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:07.000
say, Yeah, I believe in this trust manifesto and that one I can't agree with because it's got you know some component that makes sense in your world doesn't make sense in my world.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:15.000
So there's gonna be kind of a you know continuing negotiation of how we name things and what we're naming.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:22.000
And so I guess maybe the the root of all of that is it's really important to be clear about the different things that you're trying to name.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:34.000
That you're probably when people are using different words sometimes they're using it for the same thing, sometimes they're using it for different things, and you have to back reverse engineer what the things are that you're naming and

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:53.000
then make sure that everybody's clear on you know when I say this, I mean, you know, this particular thing the the speed of interaction mistakes can be made when one person just uses the wrong this is the word that doesn't match what

01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:07.000
I interpret that word to me so we'll we'll have to have a practice, and we'll have to get better at at at at saying, Hey, wait I think. let's let's talk about what we mean here, real quick

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:15.000
and and kind of negotiate that meeting, instead of letting it that moment go past and confuse everybody.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:26.000
So as to that there's this baton passing thing that allows one person to talking to their complete.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.000
And in the middle of that I might want to inject hey?

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Let's talk about what you mean by that word and that's not really possible in the time passing protocol that we have.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:49.000
So that's been a in question in my mind for quite a while.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Now, what's the polite way to do that

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:10.000
The Tom, passing protocol doesn't allow for that kind of injection

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Can you be brilliant, Pete? Tell me the answer.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I it's it's a longer discussion right I I think

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:43.000
The we're we're doing a pretty good job today of kind of I, you know so you and I are having a conversation when Michael Sand has been up for a while and you know I want to hear about the progress that you

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:49.000
invincible. made on you know and it's so so we're we're doing a pretty good job of kind of moving along.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:55.000
I think I also feel like I took more more floor time than I feel like i'm comfortable with.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:07.000
But but then, you know, kind of separately Wendy did Wendy did a a great job with.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I think it was one of the recent mapping calls.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Both having a queue, and then not going ahead in the queue until she closed enough loops that everybody was complete, and then moved on, and she was doing a thing where, as the moderator facilitator she was reflecting

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:44.000
back. You know the where we were in the conversation. And so that was a case in which it was really a beautiful and wonderful thing to have a moderator who is both willing to kind of let the conversation happen, but also holding space and closing

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000
loops enough so that we didn't all feel you know completely disrupted.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:55.000
So we haven't been doing that on this call and it's better in some ways, for it and a lot worse than the ways for it.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:09.000
And I also would recognize that when Wendy was doing that facilitation and holding space, it took a lot of time and energy away from her ability to think about what she wanted to say in the conversation, because she was making sure to honor the the

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:20.000
conversation for everybody else. So it's a whole bunch of stuff wound up in there that we could talk about forever.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.000
It. It makes me think of the group work group works, pattern language. actually.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I a a group of group faculty people got together.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:42.000
And wrote down different patterns of group facilitation so that they could have kind of a library.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:59.000
It's actually card deck so that they could have a a way of both communicating the craft that they were doing, and also having being able to reflect on the different kinds of process facilitation that they could employ in the moment

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:08.000
it's a way of externalizing some of their ability to do group process both for themselves and for other people.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000
It's a beautiful and wonderful thing, and we should do more of that.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:20.000
So I just. we just went through a couple of different ways that you can facilitate a meeting like this, and they're different and beautiful and wonderful in different ways.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:27.000
If we capture that in a pattern language and by the way a pattern language is not just a you know it's a highly constructed thing.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:35.000
So i'm sad when people do do call things better language when they're the Alexander style parent language.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:41.000
But anyway, we should do that, so that's kind of all of that happened in the few seconds.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:58.000
All of that happened to my head and the the few seconds that you were talking about the time passing, and and when to pass when the potential gets passed, when it doesn't how to pass them

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Maybe it's Vincent. Yes, so I wanted to just I guess comment on the that.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:25.000
I mean, this conversation has been mainly about naming first with the Meta project, but then it kind of went into naming of the different types of entities and connecting to what I was gonna share because of having like the background, in my head i'm wondering

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:33.000
if the if a group and a sovereign are basically the same thing, even though they have differences.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
In the same way that like we all have difference but we're all humans like

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.000
There's when it comes to differentiation of things it's like, Okay, are you mainly the same thing?

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
But a different, like subtype like we're different instances of humans.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.000
But we're all humans. our sovereigns and guilds, all just different instances.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:12.000
They're unique and different. but their instances of groups and and if the relationships between a sovereign and its members and a group in its members, and it's and a gill and its members are like mostly the same not like

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:17.000
the quality of the relationship, but the fact that they have members.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Then I wonder if that alludes the fact that they are actually the same class of thing, and that they just might be different instances of it.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Not to say that there is like a main but that they're mostly similar enough to the point where they can be interchanged with any on the context

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:48.000
I I like I I like your hypothesis.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:57.000
That things are the same with the relationships are the same the there's deep water there about instances and classes of things.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:08.000
So group to me is a big class of things mostly, and guilds and sovereigns are are more so.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:16.000
So group is kind of like saying a vehicle and a sovereign is kind of like saying a truck and

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.000
A group is like saying a bus so you can say that they're both vehicles.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:26.000
But if you need a truck and you got a bus then you're gonna be sad and vice versa

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:39.000
So there's a there's a whole bunch of stuff. to kind of watch out for there in in in saying that you know they're Oh, they're close enough for for jazz you know you could use a bus to drive

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
to the grocery store, and you could use it truck to drive to the grocery store.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:54.000
But if you need you know, 20 Hayes, or if you need 16 kids, you you definitely want one kind of group and not the other kind of group.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Yeah, I the other. The other thing I was looking out, which is almost the opposite of this.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I was watching this video on how to build semantic search systems.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:22.000
By lucid works, and there was assertion that they made that every instance of a word or a phrase you ever encounter has a unique meeting.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:28.000
So anytime. You see the word sovereign mentioned in a conversation, or on a page on a text.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:41.000
It has a slightly different meaning than every other time you've seen it, even though it's the same word because of the the different layers of contacts behind it.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:48.000
That's a that's a thing that wendy Alfred will save also, she said it to me number number of times.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
So when I say sovereign, and somebody else is sovereign, and not just.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:57.000
When I say sovereign it means it a different thing each time, and then you know the difference between the way I say it, and somebody else says it.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:07.000
It's like and then there's the game b notion of don't expect everybody to articulate things perfectly. so.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Yeah, you know. So somebody's gonna use a word and but thank you it's on me to guess with this to guess what they're really trying to say, and that's a cognitive load wendy talks about let's make

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:44.000
this as frictionless as possible. Well, I don't think we're ever gonna get rid of the cognitive load of guessing , There's there's approaches to it, though the the it it when somebody says something

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:49.000
then what you want to do is enter into a conversation about oh, what do you mean, you know?

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Let's talk about that. and then there are ways to make that conversation more palatable or less palatable.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Right. The less power boy is like, Okay? Well, I wrote up a wiki page on this.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Just go read that and You'll know what I mean So that's a a really breast way to do it, and and a high friction way to do it right, or where the the worst one is Okay, I think.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I I assume that coming into this conversation you already went that Wiki Page and I don't know why you didn't, and I don't know why you're you're saying that word so that's the really

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.000
bad ways to do it. The other ways to do it is like, Oh, tell me about you know.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Tell me about what you know. Tell me about your experiences.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Tell me about your contacts that's so cool you know and then you get off into context That may not matter to the main conversation.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:45.000
But helps people be human together. And yeah, and I did that yesterday at least some she is the word sacred, and I I heard fingernails on the blackboard.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:43:00.000
And I admitted that to her, and we had a very quick merging first perspective with mine.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Yeah, it was cordial, gentle, quick, enlightening, and sweet.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:34.000
It was just exactly what you said. So I get you and I agree. and I think if people if conversations are open to that kind of sake of tension taken to, how do you say merge world views and then come back to

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:42.000
the conversation. it's pretty pretty enjoyable and and and not at all.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Friction the opposite of friction. So thank you.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:44:02.000
And and human, and in human, and it creates a deeper relationship which is cool

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:08.000
So i'm hoping to hear what you invincible have been working on.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:24.000
They type directories. Yes, I can I can share jonathan hasn't even seen this part of it yet, but because of it, I've been able to do this so I shared last week.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:40.000
This explore data types, page on catalyst, which has a like a very simple and sort of graphical representation for pictorial representation for each main data type.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:56.000
So the idea is that these are all like distinct data types that if you were designing a relational database you could kind of pick which ones you're going to use and now and then be able to then

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:06.000
have a schema for each one of these data types. where you can interoperate with anyone else who is like, Oh, yeah, we're both using the language of schema So like, if we're gonna both use languages in our application.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Then we should have some sort of similar way of representing languages in a way that we can.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:20.000
You know. Have someone who speaks one language on one app transfer the data to another app, and then it shows that they're speaking the same language.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:38.000
And so, basically as i've been doing research in the last, like 3 4 years over the different types of social networks that have been out there. I've kind of been keeping a Italian like any time I find a

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:43.000
new data type that I feel like doesn't fit into one of these I will add it to this list.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:59.000
And so this is kind of become like the synthesis of the like high level schemas that most social networks or matchmaking platforms or directories have or the way that people will use tools like air table or Google

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:09.000
sheets. to kind of represent certain types of data, more so with air table where each table is like kind of a unique tab.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:20.000
In the same way that if you were to like, you know, have preset options for like long text attachment checkbox when creating a a new column.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:25.000
What if when you, if you created a new tab, you kind of picked through a dropdown list of like, hey?

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Is it one of these cause? If so, we can either automatically populate this for you with information like, Oh, is this a language database?

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Well, here's all the lines or it could infer some things like, Okay, this is a list of links.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:47.000
You probably want a Url field by default. and so

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Then what that led me to start doing was to create A.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Oh, a directory of the data type relationships because I think this is to be able to actually see how these are used.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:10.000
It's really helpful to see the relationships so I made this where you can say, Okay, platforms have servers, for example.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:16.000
You know, like discord is a platform that has different discord.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Servers, and then those servers have channels and channels, have messages, and this is a relationship that scales across like matter.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Most slack telegram discord like any type of chat platform.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:39.000
We'll have this structure, and so that went into this relationship. Diagram and I have right now nothing is there's no connections being showed.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.000
But you can toggle on and off the relationship types.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:58.000
So one that I did was can be so there was a lot of people that are always asking me like what's the difference between a project and a group, and i'm like, well, these are all the things that can be other things at the same

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.000
time, so like a project can be a group, and it also could be a resource.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:09.000
A group could be an organization. and it can also be like you can share a post about a group.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:14.000
But these are still distinct things in the way that I see.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:27.000
They each have different like functions, and they have differences between them. So there's this other tab that I started working on during this call, which is just like differs from So like what If you wanted to see what were the differences

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:36.000
between these things. And so like, you know, groups are different because they are about people involved, not about the output of something.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:43.000
And then the have shows the release, the kind of hierarchical relationship between these different things.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:50.000
So, for example, if you were to hover over groups, you can see that groups have users.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:49:02.000
The Gray is a relationship type between 2 types. So, for example, a user group is like would hold information like when you joined a specific group.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.000
What your role is in a specific group. So that would be a data type.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:19.000
That is a relationship type. and group relationship is, you know, between 2 groups is a group relationship which would also have, like the relationship between the groups.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:25.000
So yeah, this is basically, And then I have differ from connect. serve.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Take action on. And so this is kind of the graph, at least catalyst or the different data types in catalyst, and how they connect.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:47.000
And I would I would say that the the next layer to have on top of this could be

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Another dimension could be the platform. So like If you took factor, then you could have a different set of relationships between these data types on factor.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:07.000
For example, and so this could be like a template that could be applied towards different platforms that have schemas.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:14.000
But then you could also overlay those on top of each other, and then see which ones have like matching shapes.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:26.000
And matching patterns like the connections between shapes which would be like, Oh, look inherently open impact, and catalyst could interoperate entirely, as is with their projects.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Schema, because projects have tasks, tasks. can be opportunities.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:44.000
And this is this is like the same structure so kind of like the way that in a cell your dna will have like like a protein will have like a protein receptor, and if they match it binds

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:55.000
i'm wondering if, like these are could be like proteins and then different platforms could input different data sets like connected data sets.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:10.000
If they have a certain matching structure very cool that's really cool, great job guys that's fun.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
I can see that being the work that you're doing to map all that out.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:23.000
I can see it being echoed on a lot of different a lot of different ways, right the way i'm I didn't realize Kuma could do that right at the bottom pick the different tabs.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:35.000
And then it. it shows different relationships. I think that's really fun like immediately makes makes me think about map weavers. and you know all the different ways that we could show how projects are related to each other, and how an initiatives are

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:41.000
related to each other, and how people are related to each other that's really fun.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Yeah, I guess my my question is are there any relationship types or like other layers that are missing for the on this that would be helpful for other platforms like, That's the kind of question i'm asking Now, is like

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:08.000
what What other layers should there be on top of this visualization to help people actually be able to get more more use out of it.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Can you show it again get it with that in mind needed by

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:30.000
I was muted. so Jonathan you're saying like could you give an example?

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Not sure. it pretends to this one cause. This is data types.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:52.000
But projects Project Day could be needed by Project B. So I may be speaking out of context.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:58.000
So that would be like an instance of a project. Needs another project correct?

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:16.000
It might apply here but I think it's I'm trying to bang a square peg into a round hole, trying to apply it to you to the data types como diagram.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Good data types, I don't think data types need other data types.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Yeah, I can think of one. Oh, sorry you know how vincent when we were doing tapestry, where we're looking at we hadn't gotten to this point yet of showing the strength of relationship between 2 , might be a nice

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:44.000
one like I don't know whether that would be nested inside of every kind of relationship you're creating.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:49.000
But you know how strongly things are related to each other, especially when we start.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:55.000
And again, maybe data types, isn't isn't the good a good, necessarily a good relation, you know.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Good application for that. But definitely, when we're talking about projects or people right, the first thing I want to understand is, you know, is this person.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:10.000
The leader of this group Is this person just a member? Did they just hear about it like the getting at that kinds of relationship?

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Is becomes key very, very quickly, because otherwise it helps to pull the nest.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Then, you know, then the the nest of data apart and bring high, you know, highlight things.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Right, so that it could show waiting I think it can show waiting actually.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Oh, yeah, I think the connection wait. You can have a width of the line thickness which is correlated with the the weight.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000
My question would be, what would determine the weight like like.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:55:03.000
So users having contributions or users, having skills would the weight be the number of platforms in which there's a relationship between users and contributions or users.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:12.000
And you know groups. or would it be the

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Yeah, like one. It could be the frequency that both of those data types exist out of a sample size of platforms.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:35.000
My answer is let's have a long discussion about that

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Where each kind of response right, whether it was expertise, or whether some of them required different definitions of the strength, and some of them seem to group like.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:51.000
When we got down to the resources it it seemed to repeat itself over and over and over.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:56:01.000
It didn't meant really matter. The type of resource it was either a suggestion or i'd used it, or I owned it, or I was right like the were a couple i've forgotten exactly the wording, I came to

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:04.000
but right there was a set of 4 or 5, and then you had even gone.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Well, we could just use strength as a like 1 one through 5, right like we could into from from A.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:18.000
From a data standpoint, having some consistency around the you know there's not a forever there's not a limit.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Unlimited number of types of strengths. You know what I mean, and and you bring it down to like 4 or 5.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Then it starts to help to. So I would use that same principle here right.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:34.000
But what would determine the strength, the the degree of strength?

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.000
I think determine, you know, is should be determined by the I mean.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:45.000
You guys would be the best to discuss that because I don't understand it in a relationship between data types as well right.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:57:03.000
But I bet there would be some patterns there. Yeah. I also think that you know, throwing a few numbers or a few weights, and then doing your kuma diagram, and seeing if that really helps , experiment with the first before you put a bunch

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:22.000
of time into it presents to you. And yeah, it could be helpful, or it could be not at all helpful. Yeah. And then you could do interesting things, too like snap to snap to a circular grid the things.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.000
That have stronger weight, so that they bring closer.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I only show those things whose connections have high weight wait greater than 3, because then it helps again pull the nest apart a little, bit, and help to see .

01:57:40.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Inside. Oh, and it shows kind of if if you only show high waiting stuff that shows you the first order of sense making, and then you can lower the weight and good, you know.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Move towards overwhelming I can choose how much you ideally you'd get to choose how much you want, how much overwhelming you want.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:26.000
I think the more important question is defining what the waiting means, because another waiting, which is completely different than I just thought of, is looking at like within one platform, like within catalyst.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Looking at the like, for example, the number of users that have contributions compared to the number of users that have projects.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Then that that will show how how often the information is filled out.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:53.000
And that could show like where people are actually spending their time which That's another way to represent the data which it could mean that the interface hasn't been designed or is it it's a bad ui and people.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Aren't filling out a certain data type because they don't they can't figure out how or it could be, because that's something that people feel more is more important to fill out.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:07.000
So there's bias there, and it would I think it would.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Yeah, I think, figuring out what you would actually want that waiting to show.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:18.000
And then even then it would probably be biased in some way.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:30.000
I think that would be the the most important question to ask before even figuring out how to visualize or how to interact with it.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:48.000
So you've identified that there are different kinds of waiting, and each one has a a corrupt ability via the bias.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Well, yeah, cause the waiting is it's we're kind of making a model right?

01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:09.000
It's. This is like a a model of data types and yeah So your sample size is going to affect the waiting, and if you're sample size is one platform, then there's other factors that affect the the waiting that are

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:14.000
even more pronounced based off of that designer, that one platform.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:38.000
So it seems to me that the oh, bye, Wendy, but seems to me that the question mutates, into what good will waiting do any particular viewer

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Yeah. and and my intention for creating this is the audience or the viewer would be someone who it either has a platform or is developing a a schema to collect data.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:01:12.000
And so, for example, like I just created an air table and i'm about to collect, create a map of people and projects. and I want to be able to reference a a schema to see how other people set up the relationships between these different

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000
data types or the different tabs in an air table.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:28.000
So that is the context in which I think this visualization would be helpful and useful.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Truck i'm having trouble parsing up so the easiest way for me to

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:49.000
I guess it's kind of doing the reverse of what the air table based schema does so.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:56.000
If you create an air table, you can add this app called Bay Schema.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Here, and it will show you the different tables and then how they're related.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:18.000
So the team's in the fields so like within data types. there's data type relationship, and that is you know, data type relationships has a relationship to relationships to the data type of from and it.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Too. So this is kind of the reverse it's like looking at the the schema, and then saying, Okay, this is like the schema here.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:48.000
We're only interested in users. But if we want to add like, Oh, these are some other tabs that we can add to our air table to collect data, and then we these are like standard relationship types between these between these data types

02:02:48.000 --> 02:03:06.000
which would make it so that when we create this air table it's going to be interoperable with the catalysts day schema, and any other air table that uses this protocol Oh, okay, I I also like

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:12.000
that the way you clicked on user it just grayed out.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Most of the other bubbles, and retained the coloring of just a few.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:42.000
And what that spoke to me is that seeing all the data types like by what the hell. but seeing just a few and how they relate gives me a sense of focus that wendy's waiting would also do and maybe

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:56.000
isn't as necessary as I think so yeah it it could the idea of waiting could go forward or not.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.000
I don't care

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Doing really cool stuff instant, and and I probably some of it is is new and different.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:16.000
I think you might want to look at upper anthology. Here's a wikipedia article about upper ontologies, and read about those. and then ontology portal org is this sumo upper

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:23.000
ontology. And then that guy wrote a book. are there.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Is there a particular conference with ontology port that, or is this like all of the Internet ontology portal org?

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Is there's so there's a set of up ontologies upper ontologies are basically a just like scheme is for ontologies more or less.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:49.000
So then ontology. portal org is a particular one, called suggested upper merged ontology.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Which has a couple good qualities compared to other up ontologies one of them is that it's open and and free as opposed to likeike.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Is maybe the oldest kind of ontology and up brownology, and it's not free and not open some of the lessons about how to so how to construct an upper ontology.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:27.000
It you're you're like you're in that space kind of, and they're probably a bunch of you know bunch of things like you know.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Waiting. How do you do that? How do you order things?

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
How do you structure things? You know, How do you? How do you generalize?

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:44.000
How do you that kind of stuff it's there's probably a fair bit of fair bit of thought about it.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Even though a lot of it's kind of mathematical more than more than you want.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:55.000
There might be good stuff that you might find inspirational or useful.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Yeah, Thanks for sharing this. It: Yeah. It gives you some other words to use.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:07.000
So is is what I shared a type of merged ontology.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:12.000
I I think it's I I this is way out of my expertise.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:18.000
I think it's it's pretty close to an upper ontology, and upper andtology means that, hey?

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:26.000
If you've got a bunch of different schemas let's make a meta schema, so that we can, you know, all talk together.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Okay, Yeah, and I i i'm sure this is with a lot of these upper schemes. they're context specific right? like It's a upper schema for the medical diagnostic industry.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:43.000
It's it's actually the the the good ones and Sumo, for instance.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:55.000
They have Sima itself, and then they have different ontologies for communications, countries and regions distributed.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Communicate community user interfaces, economy, etc., etc.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Geography, people emotions, physical elements viruses, whether another cool thing about sumo in particular, is it maps to word net.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:22.000
So word net is a semantically related network of lots lots of English words.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:32.000
So we're not is kind of a a problem practical thing you know, because it's got all the you know all the common words.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000
And then if that's mapped into Sumo i've i've never seen that before.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:51.000
But you could it? It would make similar more more accessible, I think, because you could look up a word and word not, and see that it's related to you, know

02:07:51.000 --> 02:08:04.000
I clicked this on the sumo and it's it's, it seems like it starts with entity or Yeah, the most general thing.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:13.000
But then it goes down really quickly into useful things, you know, like coloring or

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Right. It's interesting because the things at the edge of this are very specific.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:25.000
2 dimensional angle contest attribute. Yeah.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Olyhic attribute think these need definitions.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:38.000
This is really cool, though.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Yeah, this is real. This feels very comprehensive in like the realm of like representing information in different ways, and and being able to do that thing you were talking about where you can map you know, one thing to another thing.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:03.000
If you got the relationships kind of set up correctly.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Yeah, Interestingly, I notice it's a one dimension one directional graph.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Yeah, higher hierarchy. Yeah.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.000
I had to look up a lehic because I didn't believe it was a word I mean.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.000
I I but do they misspell athletic or something?

02:09:50.000 --> 02:10:11.000
So Alithic refers to the various modalities of truth, such as necessity, possibility, or impossibility, like, Okay, I need a word for that interesting

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Every time interesting to impose. Hey, filter that oh! showed tenth grade words.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:39.000
The standard public discourse suggests not using anything past tenth grade for vocabulary to reach the greatest audience.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:54.000
There's another cool thing called basic English which has 100 850 words, and there's an actual Wikipedia where it's all basic English. Huh!

02:10:54.000 --> 02:11:03.000
That's cool. it's a good way to learn a language Yeah, you memorize those 850 words.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000
I guess it's simple English they they went a little bit farther.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:13.000
I think they probably use a 1,000 words or something like that.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:21.000
So the interesting thing that I keep running into when it comes to.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:27.000
So like i'm super interested in this page you sent me Pete and then i'll be like

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Okay mapping to all of word nets i'll click here. and then I get to a github, and i'm just like this is the most unhelpful way of communicating information and I almost feel like

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:51.000
a inherent like out of principle i'm not gonna engage with it, because, like you have to do better than this, like a list of like file names that say like read me, relations.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:12:06.000
There's like nothing you would know is inside until you opened it and there's no like visual hierarchy, and then it just says like like it's added rules for kills like that.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Helpful to me at all like I don't even know what this is like.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Is there something i'm missing in terms? of like is there, something that you like learn when you become a software developer and use github that like makes this suddenly understandable?

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Or is it as bad as I think it is Yes, it's somewhere in between . a software developer understands what to do with with something like this. And would start to look for you know, patterns and and unfoldings

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:45.000
and stuff like that. I I i'm a software developer and I'm.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:52.000
I'm inclined to just go fuck this Well, there's there's structure there, right the read.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Me file is going to be the the thing that you read so you don't care about anything else until you read the read me file and then if it's a bunch of text files you go Okay, Well, i'm gonna have to

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:11.000
download those text files and and look at them It's It's a it's it's like you.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:24.000
There's a sign outside of a building and it says automobiles, and you open the door and it turns out to be the workshop, and you see, you know, parts scattered all over the place, and that you know if you

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:32.000
were looking to drive a car today you're going Well, i'm gonna close the door and walk some place off

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:40.000
It feels like the opposite of a mall, where, like a mall, you walk inside, and then you could, like, wander through and like, go in and out of other buildings.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:53.000
This feels like an opposite building, where, like you walk inside, a room, and then, if what you are looking for is not in there, you have to leave and walk to the other side of the building go in another door.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:59.000
But but if you were excited it it's like walking into the the workflow.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:18.000
The you know the the the it's it's it's like walking into the shop, and you're told that like it's like walking into the automotive repair section rather than walking into the the showroom and you know if

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:29.000
you're interested in fixing cars and and you know. you were already, you know you need about lifts and and pneumatic drills and and wrenches and stuff like that.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:38.000
You go, hey? i'm home i'm gonna pick up a wrench and do something, And if you're looking to drive a car, you go, why would you put me here?

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Why why did the the sign on the front say there's cars here?

02:14:42.000 --> 02:15:02.000
There's not cars. I just see parks good nice we wonder if there's a format for providing information that helps people go into the right door.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:23.000
You know, imposes the request on the guy who creates the signage that says automobiles that that signage should also say automobile, factory or shop, or design or facility.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:30.000
So the the problem there is it's hard to determine a priori, what you know who's gonna understand the sign right?

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Automobile factory is gonna be useful. for people who understand factories, and it's not going to be useful for people who don't understand factories.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:48.000
And then, you know, for the person who's looking for a shop or a factory, you know I it's so a quick answer is, is Google.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.000
If if, Vincent, you ended up there, and you just googled word, not

02:15:52.000 --> 02:16:03.000
You would find, you know, an explanation of what we're net was, and why you give a shit.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:11.000
I I had to. I had to do that with I I started knowing that, psych and open site were something close.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:17.000
So it's like Okay, So what is site and I had to I was actually doing a lot of image searches, you know.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Can I see a picture of what psych is? Can I see a picture of what a anthology and upper ontology is

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.000
So you can find much better portals to what wordnet is i'm.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Not sure that you can find better portals. to with similar Simo is very big graph of the taxonomy is to me the most helpful thing because it's not like a kiff file and then I have to

02:16:53.000 --> 02:17:00.000
go look up. What a kit file is to understand what they're even doing

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:03.000
And then you have to find a viewer for a kit file.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:12.000
And yeah, Oh, is that right? Okay, Cause: yeah, I was like this is not

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Yeah, like clicking through these. it's just really funny just like the amount of yeah for me, the kumar that I made. It was like I wanna build this in a way. that it can be explained to like a 8 year old

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:36.000
and I I I don't know I feel like that's something that is much needed, and in this sort of like semantic ontology sense.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:42.000
And then, in another sense, I feel like there's people that are just like, not do the Ai.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Are. gonna Figure it out. We don't really need to know how it works like we don't need to visualize it.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Link. stop with your pretty Kumu grabs

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
I it's gonna be a long time since we're there.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:01.000
So. So, having people like you make things that are make sense.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:12.000
This really important? Yeah, 2. And these request for friction reduction.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Did. I did. Sorry, jonathan go ahead I was just saying I feel like I'm coming over to the dark side when it comes to structured or unstructured data. I watch this talk and it kind of I don't

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:36.000
know, convinced me these were there like 3 assertions and they're philosophical, which makes sense because it's not like provable.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:43.000
But what they he said was unstructured data is actually hyperstructured data.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.000
It's a graph that contains much more structure than typical structure data.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:56.000
And i'm like, Oh, yeah, that makes a lot of sense like it it's just so structured that we can't even understand the structure.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:12.000
And so what i'm doing is in a sense like with trying to make like a structured ontology, it's it's actually less structured than you? but it is more compressed and and therefore

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:26.000
lossy but it's more understandable because the unstructured free t This unstructured free text is so structured that it's not comprehensively structured that's really smart

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:31.000
yup,

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:43.000
And we definitely need organization and and structure to like. Communicate, then collaborate

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Yeah, efficiently. Yeah. So then, it's no matter whether they make it explicit or implicit, and and how you negotiate the understanding of it, and all that kind of stuff, thanks that'll be a fun one the

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:13.000
one to watch. Yeah, Yeah, the the second assertion the the that graph is rich, but it's a compression of meaning into a lawsuit format, and that data science is essentially the decompression from this lossy format into a

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:17.000
reconstituted form which you kind of need to like.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Repeat 3 times to really understand. I feel like yeah that's a good one.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:36.000
And like i'll condense to dehydrated food products.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:48.000
The reconstituted form can taste like crap, or can taste great.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Yeah. So , Oh, John, thing you read it, depending on how it was.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Concentrated. Some concentrations are actually really good when reconstituted, others not so much

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:27.000
So I'm: curious to see if i've accurately represented the data types and or data type relationships within massive wiki.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:38.000
And seriously, or if you guys know what those are, or have like, written, map them out in some way.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:44.000
I massive Wiki probably seriously as well. Is it kind of a general purpose tool?

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:59.000
So there's the stuff that you record and then you have an implicit, usually implicit kind of schema in your head. and for me, maybe in Bill Anderson's head that that says how to decode you know what's

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:03.000
what's there? So it's Hyper structured and then, you have to ask me or Bill you know.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Okay, So what's the what's the Schema here?

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Why did you form it this way? Well, I think what i'm referring to?

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Is the Meta schema. so like massive Wiki has, you know, organizations or groups, or maybe it doesn't.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Maybe it just has users and, like you have a user profile, right?

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:34.000
And then users have wikis and then wikis have pages and pages have text, and that's it.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:39.000
That's the structure, and then within that everything else is there are other.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:50.000
There's other structure that is not imposed but you can't do anything outside of that structure like if you break that structure, you break mass of the key, So there is some structure that can't be broken.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Yeah, it's a little bit more complicated than than than what you just rattled off and not much more complicated.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Yeah, and seriously isn't even that complicated

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Where it's more complicated, tight hyper less structured.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:27.000
How about that? which which means it's more hyper instruction yeah. yeah.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:34.000
But in the works all on you, Right it would. Vincent is creating,

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Does a lot of work, in addition to what people add for content.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Mine only allows you to edit move things around I think it's just what I want it doesn't do what you want.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:03.000
So

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:20.000
There, there is still these common patterns that even with seriously with. Its like this, with the simplicity in the types of data they're still like, for example, like John, that we were talking about interactions.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Right. And then, within interactions like there are certain there are different interactions you could make onto a node in seriously whether that's like expand or contract or

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Add to or or like. so like saying, like you have a graph which has nodes and edges and then interactions.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:48.000
And you can make an interaction on the note or the edge.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:57.000
I think you could make interaction with the multiple nodes, which is a kind of cool, unique thing, right?

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Can you like select multiple nodes? Yeah, but the all you can do is move them when you say it's still an interaction moving.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:17.000
Okay, Alright, my arm is twist

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:25.000
I think i'm a limpet clutching to the rock called Humility.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:34.000
So so maybe another time we should, we should try to map different things since then.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:50.000
With you like massive wickers. or seriously or or sovereigns, or you know, Meta Project Rogm, or yeah, that'd be fun.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:26:09.000
And I think what would be, what we'd spend the longest time on is probably just figuring out when to create a new type, and when to merge, because the relationships are similar enough, like for example, I have visualizations,

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:26.000
or like pages. I don't actually even know what the best way to represent it is but I think it's something like, let's see see if I have it here.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Page. Okay, Yeah. So platforms have pages and page have different views.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:47.000
But also visualizations have views, and then the views have the data objects, data, objects, types, etc., etc.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:54.000
And you interact with data objects so like in notion you have like notion the platform.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:27:09.000
But then there's actually something in between here. which is like the wiki like you have different notion dashboards, and then those have pages, and then each one of those pages have yeah different views or just one view of

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:16.000
like blocks which are the different, like objects, and you can move those. you can interact with those blocks like you could move them.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:19.000
You could delete them, you could edit them

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:24.000
And they have the blocks. Have a type like. Is this a text block or an image block?

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:31.000
So like this, probably with one thing added with like, I would say, represent notion pretty well.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:38.000
But then it would get into semantics of like. Is it just a sub page?

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Or is it another thing? the like

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:58.000
I wanna go on attention. Take you up on your request for new data type suggestions.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:10.000
I wanna I wonder if we could add sovereign and guild to your data types?

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:36.000
So, as I was hypothesizing before. I think Pods sovereigns, guilds and teams are all types, are all instances of a group or a set of people fair enough and in the less unless the relationship between a

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:45.000
sovereign is like has different relationships than this then I feel like it's the same.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:54.000
It's a different instance of the same thing. So like if a sovereign has resources and members and values and activities.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:29:02.000
And there are relationships between other sovereigns and there's a language that people in that sovereign speak, and there's relation.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:08.000
And This honor might host events then, it's probably a group is my hypothesis.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Okay, then, to my understanding of what a sovereign is it breaks that cause.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:38.000
It adds one more thing called self governance. so the the other late, I think what would be interesting is to add a layer of all the deltas so like add sovereign as a type, and then lay out the the differences.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Being a sovereign and a group and then see are there more differences or like, if there's only one difference, or if there's 50 differences like if the ratio would I wonder if the relationship that the ratio between

02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:02.000
the number of differences, and the number of similarities between those things means it should be the same.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Yeah, i'm with you yeah, should we add self governance as a field that all groups may have or not have.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Yeah, i'm i'm with you but if if self-government is is enough to inspire it to be as a subtype a separate type.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Then I think guilds would be a subtype of sovereign cause.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:40.000
It has differences that people points out, and I agree.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Why at so you asked for? suggested suggestions to add new types.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Does my curiosity about sovereign and guild fit into that?

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:09.000
The spirit of your question request, or or were you thinking something else actually W.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:21.000
My request. What I was trying to request is what layers would need to be added over the visualization to make it more helpful.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:25.000
So, for example, saying, we want to have a toggle.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:30.000
That shows the differences between things, was an answer to my own question.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:38.000
That I came up with from posing the question which I think would be helpful is like it's it's not changing anything.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:51.000
It's just adding another layer that you can turn on or off. So another layer could be fields, so I could take the list of like 200 fields which are already connected to data, types and I can add that as another layer

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
on the graph that you can toggle on or off.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:32:02.000
So now you could see, Okay, what are all the fields connected to group And then you can see which fields are connected to like 4 or 5 things.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Like everything, has like groups and projects. Both have an address.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:14.000
And all of them have done. Yeah, Yeah, interesting, hey? I wonder, Vincent, do you want to?

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:23.000
Want to work on on. Maybe I I think again, a good next step would be just mapping different things right.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Would you want to do that on a flatel call like next virtual call?

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Or do you want to do a separate call? We could do that honestly.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Telecom yeah, next week. So you mean matting like a an instance so like in the same way that this is kind of the catalyst incense.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:33:03.000
So let me see taking math of wiki and we're or seriously, and making a map of it, and then teasing it out that you know what's the difference between servers and groups, and and guilds and

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:22.000
probably some other things. And seeing it that you know if that fits in the the uprontology that you've got, or if it yeah, so, what what I would do is I would add, this field called platform And just take So these are the

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:25.000
relationships, and I would tag all these relationships catalysts.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:42.000
But then, if then, you could add for example you know a wiki ha has pages and pages have, or I don't know.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:59.000
Maybe this is documents. right, and documents have objects, and then these can be tagged with massive wiki, and then we could add a toggle where you could toggle between the different platforms and see

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:29.000
how it maps. Yeah, I like it. I have to take off for another call and a super fun one, and I like the I like the anthology stuff that You've got thanks for helping sure
