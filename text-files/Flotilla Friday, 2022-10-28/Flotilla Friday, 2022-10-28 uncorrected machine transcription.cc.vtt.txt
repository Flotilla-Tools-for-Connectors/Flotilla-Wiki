WEBVTT

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so this could be useful for other people who are just thinking to join the screen.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
A little introduction. Yeah, exactly. I figured yeah if we're gonna give a we.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We're. gonna give an intro we get to to have it on the record.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Describing the other one vincent i'll go first. So Vincent's working on Catalyst, which is kind of a multi-directory community, events and communities and people so it's like

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:55.000
a i'm going to say something which actually really underplays. It it's kind of like a massive roll-odox of like like if you wanted to get stuff done to make the world a better place you would look at

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
vincent's roland x except it's it's like a 100 times better than a roll of X.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Because Vincent does magic stuff to interrelate everything.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And so, and he keeps adding stuff to it i'm helping him. He's doing the work there's a tiny little part where I can help a little bit, which is something that keeps track of just like zoom chats that are

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
going on for a call, and all the links in them, and who said What and stuff like that?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So for each event that a group is having convinced it has a page for each event, each meeting, and then there's all the things about that meeting.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You know what Links got brought up, what resources got mentioned.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You know the organizers can put additional information. Other notes like from a Hackham D.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Or something like that really really amazing and cool. so relationship to flotilla.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Flotilla is largely It's kind of me and Vincent and another guy.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Charles Bloss was also one of the original founders of flotilla. I like Charles. Yeah.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:28.000
He's a good guy we've we've Got common interest in both helping people organize information or organization getting organized for people, and then helping people use that information to learn about each other.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Find out. How can I help? How can I get help what can I do So That's kind of the gist of Flagello.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And then for interoperation. we're talk talk Each talk about our tools, and how they could interoperate with each others tools, and then with other things outside of that too very cool. amazing.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I I can tell you that I I think what i'm doing will add something interesting to this Mix bet we'll see as we go.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So, Vincent, are you gonna yeah i'm gonna take on the massive task of So So massive wiki

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So there are a lot of different Wiki software and platforms.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I would say the thing that differentiates massive Wiki is.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It's also a protocol for having a Wikipedia that by its design can host the data and pull data from different repositories.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So, for example, you could you could set up a massive wiki and decide to host it on obsidian.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Using the massive Wiki protocol and have the data starting.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Github, and so in essence, it is like a protocol that can be kind of applied towards lots of different tools.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So people kind of have their own tool they like using whether It's Rome notion, and so I think one the kind of mission of massive Wikipedia correctly. if i'm wrong is like to be able to let

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:24.000
people have the way of pick their platform, but be able to have this like shared protocol for setting up Wikis in a way that allows for interoperability across different rules.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So. does that mean that from my obsidian I could connect with your notion of Rome?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Or does it mean that I would go to a wiki and see my notion, my obsidian, your notion, his room, that kind of thing?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000
It it means this is a really cool exercise by the way Vincent: Yeah.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And i'm sorry I maybe I put you on this bottle of it. But she did a great job, so I don't know and welcome to whoever this mark this.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Is yeah, Michael, Another another regular Hey, Michael, Hello, it's classes.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
We we talked a little bit about catalyst now we're talking a little bit about mass of Wiki, and it would be interesting to talk about factor.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And then Sam's projects. So the the the the the it's basically the idea of massive Wiki is is to use really standard and really basic things to to host A wiki, And then also those things just by

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
nature will end up being interoperable with a bunch of stuff.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So if up city and is, is maybe the main tool we like to use as a massive, wicked client, and if you had stuff in notion, and what you would do is export Markdown. so massive wiki is

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:00.000
all about markdown and interchanging, sharing, sharing work down files and versioning them and things like that I could get with.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Yeah, why Wiki is sort of a kiddish, anyway.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So Yeah, it's. it's a markdown Wiki with, Okay, get is the the sharing and versioning protocol. we like best. But we've tried a couple different ones, too.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I I i've become a fan of Markdown.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Since I started up. Obsidian: So yeah, very cool, very interesting.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And he also has other projects like massive human intelligence project and the collective sense commons which that's how we connected.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And I'm. Curious how you found your way into the csc matter most.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:47.000
But that's one of the things that pete is the super admin of, and is set up and kind of provides that as a service to like and goes system of different communities.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It's. It i've been i've kind of run into so many groups in the last couple of weeks like last month.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Maybe collective sense. commons and like even just kind of getting out to highlight and matter what?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And the yeah. All these groups the Ogm: the

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Yeah, a bunch of them catalyst yeah so i'm like swimming in.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Oh, I you know it's it's so much information and I'm.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Also very focused on what i'm doing so but these are all like so integral to this sort of mission that i'm also on which is like about harnessing human intelligence.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Height. Hmm! like allowing us like you know a lot of people. I don't know this a lot of people are just like, well, just you know, artificial intelligence will solve this problem.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Like we we can't do it we gotta like hand it off like we just we haven't tried we just haven't really.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We haven't really put our minds to this democratic in sense, making collective collaborative sense making project that you know you guys are all, you know, part of it.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And i'm also working towards so so it's great It's just great to see that other people are like picking.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:17.000
They're all you guys all have like grab different strands of this challenge that we're face facing.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I mean if we don't figure this out we're gonna die. you Know It's like we're all gonna die if we don't figure this out so that's how I see it Anyway, i'm not everyone

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
agrees with me. but so this says to me like this is what it's about.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So do you have when, when, you're helping human intelligence Do you have How do you do that processes tools? you know.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:59.000
If you want, I can jump in and tell you about what i'm building So what it is is it's it's, you know, like so many of these things, you can explain it from many different angles.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
But in many ways. One way is to say that it's a liquid democracy platform.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Another way is to say, it is that sir collaborative sense speaking platform

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So the the concept is that Oh, hello! do it, Jonathan.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So what it is is it's it's at its core it's it's like proposals, you know.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Challenges our request for proposals proposals are you know statements about what you'd like the group to do.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And then and then there's a voting system on top that combines so score voting rank choice and approval voting.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And so there's voting on every statement like on proposals. and then within the proposal, our substatements that are designed to help people understand why the statement understand detail like workout details of the statements understand why people like

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
it, or don't like it like Why, or why not type statements, and then all of those are votable.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So someone proposes something. people will vote on it. and say why they like it, or don't like it.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And then you can propose alternate statements. alternates.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Sit in the same holders this as the prop, like an alternate proposal or an alternate. Why not?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
If you think you could state the same, why not better, or whatever it is?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And so the alternates sit alongside the original ones and then once there's more than one then it turns into a right choice or a you know approval type voting otherwise it's well, it's still approval.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:49.000
That's just one but it gets into more interesting voting types. So it's a way of of of iterating on ideas to find solutions that are synergistic satisfiers ultimately.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So it's it's. meant to be in a political arena it's also meant to be a storage of the thinking that went into the final decision.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
So you can understand when you can see the statements that were made.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Help the amount of agreement that each Stephen has had on.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000
You know, in the process like if if I said you know what's you know it's build a dam, and you know, people said, you know.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Now it could cost this problem like what's this damn building for why?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Why are you building it? Well, because we want to gain energy, and we want to store water.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
K. Why don't we here's an alternate proposal why don't we set up you know how swales?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And you know storage things, and to store the water, and, you know, altering proposal swells, and you know why or what you know.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So you can kind of follow the trail of the thinking that went to the into the final decision

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Calls with any of like the topic quest or reason score any of them.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Yeah. Yeah. So I had a had a really great meeting with

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Bentley Davis and he actually he's the one who told me about how you guys, so I would not have found this group Hadn't, if it hadn't been for him and I I can't even remember I found him

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:30.000
but but yeah, and and what they're doing is similar turn generally similar, like it's it's also you know, wipedia. is that what it's called or reason pedia yeah it's related and this

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:39.000
is like, I think like I could probably find a way to integrate what he's doing into what i'm doing.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It's a little bit different. but this the thing i'm doing is a little bit more governance oriented. Since speaking of governance, it has a sense making also reasons why and why not?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
But this is more like people trying to decide what actions to take or it's not just actions.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:14.000
It could be like a group of climate scientists trying to decide on the wording of a an official statement like an official group of climate scientists trying to come up with their statements like, and they could propose alternates and explain why present evidence attachments you know

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
links, stuff and vote on the quality of the links and the quality of the attachments and the quality of this.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:33.000
You know all those things, and and as you kind of see what what everyone's positions are like how much agreement there is with each of the sub statements, and you could perhaps make a better proposal like a better statement and and

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:44.000
then with enough vote from a group of official climate scientists, for example, kind of a stamped official statement.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And then you know, the public could go in and look at for B and C. All of the reasoning that went into that statement, for example, like it could be viewable, and the evidence all the attachments, all the links everything.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So another thing you'll bump into at some point is mark and twom peril and hyper knowledge. I need to start a I need to start a list here.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Actually, I have a list. But yeah, actually, if we let me, let me share that.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:30.000
How come D Page again? And if we type things there world would be a better place. Okay, yeah.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
I need a I think I tried to go to that but I wasn't able.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
There, you don't need to sign in Oh, actually I I muffed.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I saw screwed up the sharing settings on my first go.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So it said that said that you weren't allowed or something, but it's who went to bread and puppets. Is that that's in Vermont right I went to there?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I want The person who talked about that was Mark Caranza, and he works at the Internet Archive, which is in San Francisco.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
They must be a traveling troop and okay that's cool. Okay.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I'm, looking at some code you have marked it looks like topic.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Quests reason. P. kilobat Okay, and is this the reason Pdf.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Page that i'm looking at this the page that you're looking at.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Is It's on a editing Breakdown editing collaborative market editing server called Hackham D.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Okay, And this is something that we in in these communities we use.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:46.000
How can be often to take notes? Okay, slightly less evil empire than Google documents. Yes.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Well, okay. so had her hand raising. I missed it.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I'm going to write a hyper-knowledge of Mark and Twin Prom in here, Jonathan.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Is that your way of saying you want to have something to say, or just I have a question.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Yes, d is your the thing you're describing is.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Can someone play with it yet? Yes, Do you have a link, or I do?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Yeah, it's 4 b io I I have 40 dot org for me that Io they're both going to Amazon web server.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Can you put that in? Yes, sorry I do. Links, oops.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Pete put it in. There is that the right I just set up the routing for 4 bio.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
But you're gonna need you guys can have i'm kind of trying to.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I guess, to limit the access to people who I know so because it's still certain data.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:08.000
But you guys are all good in my book so i'll send that. And when I get that there's a code you're gonna need.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Is that clicking on join, there's so when you go to sign up. There's there's gonna part of the setup process is you're making an account, and you'll need a code Yeah, The a

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:33.000
placeholder text is so close to the background color it's not interval.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Okay, Okay, I'll fix that access code. I got it i'll put it right in the document.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Oh, thanks, This document will end up being public at some point.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Okay, I did check out w w what is the Can you spell the code? it's a little ugly it's in that document I can spell it out for you

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Oh, the hack Okay, i'll just read it from there

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Yeah, lowercase and Gotcha: Yeah.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:43.000
So it would be a little interesting to hear from Wendy about what she does, and Michael about what he does, and Jonathan about what you do.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:19:04.000
If if you want the flip thing did Vincent and I did a thing where we described each other's projects which is entertaining and illuminating, you could do like a 3 way rotation Yeah.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Paper, rock scissors, paper, rock scissors, lizard, spock.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000
I'll introduce so who hasn't introduced them Jonathan Michael, I don't know, I think, that are in introducing myself.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:31.000
I guess i'm a little bit nurse introducing because I don't always feel like I have a good grasp.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:39.000
So i'm gonna do myself. so Hi Sam nice to meet you glad you're here.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Oh, thanks, Let's see so what do I do of the many variations on a theme. I have been very interested.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:58.000
I come from the world of positive psychology mostly, and I have been interested in using technology to help people thrive.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000
So to that end I had an idea 10 years ago for a new platform.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
It sounds very similar to what you were talking about definitely had ratings as part of it.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:20.000
I saw everything being in more of like a graph database although I didn't have that terminology back then, and where everything's nodes and relationships for me, I was I was visualizing more of the front end of it rather than

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:36.000
the back end of it. modeling it somewhat after ancestry dot com, And the ways that we map knowledge and then include knowledge from a global map onto our own personal map.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Once I started getting into this group, I would thought I would be meeting people where I would network and build a team and start to build out the platform.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:55.000
I was at that stage when I started realizing that everybody here has pieces of the larger, the larger vision.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And so I decided, made a conscious decision, not to develop something new, and rather to come in and be a weaver of the pieces and try to help knit things together or make introductions or support the work of other people So

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:22.000
that's what i've been doing right now I think i'm finally getting down to a nugget of something that can be done, and i'm trying to facilitate the doing of that and that piece right now

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000
is something i've called the compass which is essentially the profile version of the knowledge network.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
So just starting with the first cornerstone of the larger knowledge network, which is, how do we ask people?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
The right questions and gather the information for their own personal shift towards greater thriving.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:50.000
And so obviously, you know, as soon as you start interacting with information from other people, all the things that you just talked about are very much front and Center will.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Who gets the authority to you know where, where does the authority come from?

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000
That my idea rises above your idea. And what if we disagree, or what if we have a different version of it?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Do. I always make a different version from my own personal tree, and then we would go on our merry way.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
No, what would be better is if we start collaborating on one thing.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
But we could see what everybody's thoughts. are and that was for me always in the back of my mind.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
I've rarely talked about it in these spaces because it it was one of those things that we get added on later.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:29.000
So i'm really excited to meet you and i'm really excited to hear what you're doing, and to hear that you've you've essentially built a lot of that, if not most of it out already.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
So I would love to see how we can weave what you have with the pieces that other people are doing.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
And I think the the list that pete has put up is is really the right place to start.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:49.000
I don't have much to add to that and that part of it from my perspective, I think i'm still in the right place of doing the pro.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:23:03.000
The work on the profile and individual first, and then building in from my perspective building in the collaboration part as we go along into the larger network of all information, all the time for everyone, everywhere.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:13.000
The dream, the ultimate dream. Okay, that's great very cool we need Is there a link that you would put in the Hackham D.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Or Yeah, I think just my website, though, I need to update it with my latest chosen area focus a big mirror board.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Yeah, Okay, I'll put a couple do you want you want them on the hack in Dp. or do you want them on chat?

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Hack indeed. Probably better. Okay, i'll do that

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Keeper of the knowledge, the records, the the mammals, the the cache record, the

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Michael jonathan i'm helping mark and twon and Jack Park work on since craft which sounds a lot like what you're working on.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
I would love to have a one-on-one with you to.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Yeah, Compare candidates. They since I have them that was what you're doing.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:35.000
I I did record a bug for you Oh, there's There's yeah there's a bunch I've got a There's a whole list that the i'm not really much of a developer I saw that I just

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:43.000
thought you'd like that I am actually love it i'm a programmer.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Been programming for 40 years. Hi loathe corporate technology.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:01.000
I think it's just drive the human race crazy I think it's making it's saving the bottom line.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Of corporations at the sacrifice of being useful for anybody.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:16.000
So i'm gonna get off that bandwagon No, I I just I I totally agree that there's like

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
It's pushing the card in the wrong direction like you know anyway.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:40.000
So kind of starting from that. And I have a sibling hate for money, because I think the profit motive makes us open to the idea of flying crime.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:49.000
All kinds of things. So money is not an ethical system it's not unethical.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
It's just absent any kind of feedback match mechanism.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:11.000
So I invented a thing called civilization. Tudor tries to tackle this problem by inviting people to crowds horse what they want for civilization.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
In other words, soilization has come into being the way it is.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
In an arbitrary way, on an arbitrary path.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000
It wasn't designed pure see it for what it is and notice, hey?

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
I can make a lot of money if I cheat, or whatever

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:42.000
So designing civilization. you know, what do we really want?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:27:00.000
What would it look like, and what would it feel? like that's My goal in life is to build a game where people can experience those things designing and and then playing in it Can I

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Okay, sorry. Kyle padlock and map the city.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:19.000
He's he's building a game that isn't really my game, but he read my white paper and he loves it.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:29.000
So we're working together. nice lately. my thing has been non-technical writing.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Because well, explaining things as hard and explaining things in a way that almost everybody gets is kind of my thing, and has been since I was a kid.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:53.000
The other thing I do is alpha and beta test.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Oh, okay, so and I'm so the writing part I'm helping right the onboarding for sensecraft, and for this project that Wendy Mc.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Clean introduced me to I haven't started the latter one yet.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Well, I guess I I started it today right Wendy.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
So onboarding is is a big deal for me.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:39.000
I love to make people more productive through information so I think that's good.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
If if you wanna know more about the white paper, I can put that in the hack.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Md: yeah, better. Now, I would love to have a one on one was very open to that.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Definitely, of course, of course. Okay, Thanks. Yeah.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:09.000
I I just wanted to say i'm sorry I just like sometimes. kids i'm like an oldest child, so i'm just used to talking over all the little it's like a bad habit, right but I just wanted to

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000
say that this thing that you're talking about about the the Okay.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
I'm reading a book called the nordic ideology it's a meta meta-modern, you know.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:36.000
But i'm really enjoying it. But one of the types of politics, like the last stage of political politics, he describes is called Democratization of the politics of

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:45.000
There. So it's basically like the brainwashing that we all undergo as members of our culture.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Let's like get a hold of that and democratically decide how we're gonna bring and watch ourselves. You know the Echo Chamber and the wrong people.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Have the microphone. They have the yeah, the the crooks are running the show.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:14.000
But yeah, yeah, so like like but and and like the the There's this little group i'm in like a forum around this book that are reading, and I've just proposed hey?

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Let's start like talking about this politics of theory politics? of narrative like what?

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
What do we want to say about Ai? What do we want to say about genetic modification?

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
What do we want to say about pollution and about you know gender and race?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
And you know like what what what's the net what's the How should we brainwash ourselves more or less?

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:53.000
So you know It's great very interesting stuff, yeah I also should say that i'm working a lot with Vincent every week, and with Wendy Mcclain, and with Peter, and I would work with Michael if he

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
had the time

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Oh, cool, that's great thank you Michael said he's he's a half, and half out today.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:13.000
But smart and friendly person also and he's got a project called Factor Dot Com.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Without without the factor is a you could call it a social bookmarking tool. but basically it's a way to You could also call it a way to catalog resources and resources like links and things like that.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.000
And you can do that with a feed. you can do it together with different people.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.000
You could be doing that in Facebook and be part of the evil Empire where you could do it on factor and factor is not evil.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000
And isn't trying to make money off of you and not trying to share everything everywhere.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Yeah, and influence your behavior so that you become a better rat on a cage wheel

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000
So usually. So this is this is usually we talk about a metal level above this.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:19.000
I guess how these various things are working together. that's so exciting how we can work together.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Okay, let's do that. What What what problems that we've got into referee.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:35.000
I I have to ask you real quick some that this this particular meeting can get a little bit more technical than some of the other meetings.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
And so i'm going to ask you a question which I wouldn't usually ask you in our other meetings.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
It sounds like you're maybe not the programmer part of your operation, anyway.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Do you know anything about your tech stock? yeah yeah so yeah So it's It's all javascript more or less.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000
It's node react we've got mongo.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Db we're, using graph ql and we're using fastify, which is kind of a I guess I think it's an api man. but and that's that's more that's super helpful

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:30.000
massive wiki doesn't really have a tech stack because it's it's kind of it reuses a lot of tack, so it's it's mark down and whatever markdown editor you

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
want get, and what are the whatever? get forage and get software you want?

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000
But there's a thing called Massive wiki Builder, which is written in Python.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:48.000
I used to do some node stuff and lately i'm doing python stuff, and i'm the coder along with another guy.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
So I do python stuff. and then we host on nullify.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000
I actually do a lot of aws stuff, too, although not so much in this community matter.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Most, for instance, is running on an aws server yeah, we're on.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:18.000
We're on awesome, maybe that's just good then part of the evil Empire at the same time. what's like Yeah, it's good

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:27.000
I mean what other choice is there there's choices but they're not really Vincent.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Uses a tech stack called Bubble Bubble.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Io, which is a no code or local, maybe, is a better way to say a low code tool for developing

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Usually fairly simple. I've seen that huge and really complicated and Vincent is still managing to do it with bubble, which which is really cool.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Yeah, about catalyst, and they were like we wanna feature it, and I was like, I don't know.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Yeah, I watch him change things in bubble and it's like I love fuck.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Do you remember where everything is yeah he's Yeah, my I just just to give you a little background.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:27.000
I was building a platform called I. I was working on a a school called the Peacemaker Academy.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Just before the Covid hit and I was building some software, and I I I hired this developer like I met somebody in India and and hired this him to do some design.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:49.000
And I I use this this company called daffodil to find somebody who's who could really code I mean I Yeah, i'm crappy coder I I can do it a little bit.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:56.000
But not that's Well, then, so like like a year or 2 into the the design of this development of this thing, and I was, I launched the school.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
I had my first students and Covid hit, and I had to shut it down.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
I mean. I was teaching in the park. I brought mats out to the park, and then it was all shut down, and you know, and then

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.000
And I was just sitting on my butt and like kind of wondering like what's the universe trying to tell me?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
And and I was like listening to a lot of Daniel Schmachtenberger and A.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:24.000
You know, a bunch of other people, and just like, you know, concerned about the world.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
And and you know kind of realizing that it's really about coordination, like we're having a problem with coordination.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
That's really what it is. We need to coordinate at a higher level, like a much more level.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.000
It. We need to do like a a phase shift sort of a leap and

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:48.000
So I just was looking at all the stuff, you know. I was researching at a democracy, and I was, you know, found liquid democracy. I was like, okay.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.000
This makes a lot of sense, and looking at the different platforms out there. and I just thought, you know, I think I can do this like I think I can design this.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
You know more simply, like, more straightforward, like more universally.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
You know, and but I stopped with the coding.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:17.000
I stopped building this other thing, and the guy that was coding was, I found out he was like being mistreated like, and being paid really poorly, like 200 bucks a month, and I was paying like way more than that and

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:31.000
then So my friend from India the designer like found this guy like he wasn't allowed to talk with me. but somehow we got a hold of him, and so I became this guy and I hired him so he's like you know i've been working with him for like 4 years

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
now, so that's how i'm able to do these things because i'm paying a hell of a lot more than they were.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:46.000
But it's still within my budget and so that's kind of how I ended up being the developer of things without actually doing any code. I know some, but not that much.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:54.000
I wonder I wonder if You've I wonder if you know about Doug Engelbart and augment and things like that?

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:03.000
You'd be interested probably to to read about him and it is ideas.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:11.000
He was really early in the early sixtys doing collective intelligence, collective human intelligence.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Actually and you can. You can either look at what he where he got to, and said he succeeded, and a lot of the stuff that we use nowadays are still things that he came up with, or you could say.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:41.000
That he failed because we're still not very far better to fail at something that will eventually succeed than to succeed at something that will eventually fail.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Sort of well I he's I I met him once or twice, and have friends who worked with him a little bit post.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:03.000
His career. his life was coming to an end. It became clear that you know a few people should try to grab what they could and move it into the next generation.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:17.000
So I one of those people is one of my friends I I feel like he must have had a really tragic feeling life, because literally in the early sixtys he could see all of the stuff that we're doing.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Now, you know, with network computers and screens, and video sharing and mouses and tablets, you could see all of that and say, Ok, and we've got a big problem.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:47.000
We need to solve it together. We need to have collective intelligence, and you know, and and literally it was 20 or 30 years later before the first copycat computers started coming out. and then it was another 40 years before we got even close to the

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
stuff that he was doing in the early Sixtys you know it's like, Why is this so hard?

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Why, can't we do it so well it's you know everybody's scrambling around trying to get their piece of cheese, you know, and it's just you know hard to see It's hard.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:11.000
To see the future. Not not everybody can do that or it was a really easy for him to see the future, and really obvious.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:22.000
And it's like and the rest of the world. is like what I've got to deal with my punch cards today. I don't know what you're talking about.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Well, I mean I just I kind of got to the stage of my life where I just was like I don't have that much longer here like I should.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
And things are kind of a problem like Shitty like this is a crisis.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
And alright, what do I gotta do let's roll up the sleeves?

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000
I gotta figure this out. so. yeah, So it sounds like he was at that stage.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Maybe quite earlier in life, so I maybe not so much earlier in life, but but certainly 6 years ahead of his time, which is kind of a curse

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Even just being one year ahead. is the curse the other thing to look for when you're looking for Dugano Bart is the mother of all Demos.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:17.000
It's called and if you find some video of that it's it's a trip, Okay.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000
I'll pipe up since i'm since and then it's it's quiet at the moment.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
And say, hi! and thank Pete for for giving that nutshell.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.000
I I figured if I stayed with well away long enough, somebody would describe Factor probably do it better than I would say.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:42.000
You know. pizza good at but I will say just Sam just for for your interest.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:51.000
I I mentioned in the chat that our stack very much overlaps yours.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
And similarly, I am not the the coder of it.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
And have worked with outside developers, so what good we can do each other.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:06.000
I don't know, but interesting time happy to compare nets

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:20.000
I was also gonna say that one of the key starting points of factor, that isn't currently live is something called the Hunch, which was basically

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:31.000
You know we were. We were trying to create a way for people to post something as a hypothesis, particularly with orientation toward

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:38.000
You know things like disaster relief. just dealing dealing with crises.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:45.000
My co-founder, and I started working on this around the time of Sandy.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
So like 10 years ago, hurricane, Sandy and

00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:03.000
And it was really interesting to see that the a lot of the response a lot of the online network response on the ground.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Sandy was spontaneously handled by the occupy Wall Street folks, because they had the the web working to to deal with things and

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:29.000
And there were some other, you know. does disasters around that time earthquake in Haiti.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:45.000
And, you know. i'm trying to remember what I Guess I think it matter also have been an earthquake in in Nepal that we were kind of paying attention to to the Way Ngos were dealing with stuff like

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:57.000
that, and what you really wanted was to end for Ngos to have access to a common place where somebody could say

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.000
I think you know this happened here I don't know how it connects to anything else.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:25.000
But you guys all should know that this bridges out, or you know, this hospital does have power, cause they have a generator, and you know, and other things that people that are less factual and more like people suppose that this might be a good idea

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:33.000
to deal with it, so that other people can comment on it add evidence that does or doesn't support it.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:43.000
And give a confidence score to that supposition so that you might have like one person's brand new hypothesis.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:54.000
That's not corroborated by anybody and doesn't have much evidence behind it, or maybe has a lot of evidence, but just an odd, not a lot of visibility yet.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:03.000
And you can see how that comes on. and you know people can at mention others to say, Hey, keep a look at this.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:12.000
So people developed. both hypotheses get ratified and people develop reputation around their activity on platform.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
So is is this: is this How factor is working it's not it's actually built.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:36.000
We prototyped and built and it was such and edge use case, I mean something we could you know, but it's it's it's the it's kind of like the best thing that happens on social

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
media in some ways like you know the arab spring and the you know like

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
It's a huge yeah, it's like kind of what it should be, for, in a sense.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:55.000
But anyway, sorry. keep going. Yeah, no, I mean, I just, you know, have done a lot of of thinking and and and you know a little bit of prototyping around this

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:16.000
And and then kind of breaking it down to the idea of like well, those bits of evidence we realized we're more universally applicable, and that, you know, having being a person who observes something you know maybe maybe you're

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:31.000
in again i'm i'm dating the reference but but but you know maybe you're in Sierra Leone, and you like see this skin lesion on somebody's arm and you don't have you don't

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:38.000
have a hypothesis about what it is. It just is and you want to put it up, and you want somebody else to be able to discover it.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Maybe all you can do is tag it location and time.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:53.000
And so that lends itself to many more uses that can be, you know, dire life and death stuff like that, or it can be you know. just hey?

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Here's something I found in this place at this time What is it?

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:05.000
I think it's cool it's nice architecture in flour, or anything.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:12.000
It it it called to mind the the taiwan's response to Covid.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:21.000
A little bit. Yeah, it's interesting like and i'm just trying to think of how that could be like, you know.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Would you tag you, would tag up? you'd make a statement and sort of tag it with a variety of possible like, who would want to find this?

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Or what context would someone want to find this little message in a bottle?

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:43.000
And yeah, yeah, it's it's a good it's a really important thing.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Yes, anyways try. That would be a fun one to kind of figure out how to how to, how to make a 1 million dollars.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:11.000
No, I mean how to how to make it useful, you know yeah Unfortunately, the the how to make a 1 million dollars with it is sort of the easier course, you know, in terms of getting funding, and if you don't wanna do that and unfortunately, you know at

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.000
the beginning. We We started as a as a Vc.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Fundable, you know Delaware, Ccorp, and thought that was.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:34.000
You know where we were going and it does not does not wanna be, and does not jive with so so just for for full disclosure.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:47.000
I've been coming i've been I i'm not funded. i'm self funded and bootstrapped, and I've been really trying to figure out like cause my intention here is to like fully

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:56.000
saturate the the the public mind with the concept of liquid democratic, collective intelligence.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000
You know the technology of voting, and like a rank choice voting.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:13.000
And and you know, like I I want this to permeate the consciousness of you know the world and allow us to sort of jump up a level.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:20.000
And so i'm just thinking about how to do that and one of the thoughts, and came to my mind was well, what if I just went the Vc.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Route and like, created something that would be useful to a lot of people.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Right. So I did come up with a an alternate governance system.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:38.000
So normally. when you give money you get governance right.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:47.000
The the the the the yeah, Exactly. The the company is run by the by, the people who have put money in right.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:57.000
It's run by money you know the the fiduciary responsibility to maximize profit to share shareholders.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Right fuck that exactly So but but what but but but I may need some money at some point like i'm not rich.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000
I'm not a rich man at this moment so and so I kind of came up with this alternate system, because Forb should be.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:32.000
We should be able to eat our own dog food in a sense of manage, of governance, of being able to govern an organization. And so, looking at like, okay, shareholders are gonna want to maximize they're gonna want to keep this thing

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
alive. Not only that, but they're gonna want to make it grow and make as much money as possible.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.000
That's their motivation right users are gonna want to have this thing really work.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Well really be useful and meet their needs and be something that is like great right.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:55.000
And there's another group of people that would potentially care about the impact that this thing would happen.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Society like people who could care about democracy and care about public comments, the the the epistemic comments, and that you know all this stuff.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:18.000
And that would have to be like a board it would have to be a group of people that were sort of elected to care about that stuff, or had to prove that they cared about it, because that's not something that everybody cares about

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:27.000
so, or can think about. Well, so looking at like you know having the shareholder thing take up like roughly a third the governance.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:44.000
So if there's like a 100 investors or if there's a 100 shares, or a 1,000 shares every share that you own gives you 1 one thousandth of one third right and similarly, every user say there's a 100,000

00:51:44.000 --> 00:52:01.000
users every if you're a user you get 100,000 of one third of a vote, and then the board, including like employees and People who are elected to care about the actual impact of it, would get like say there's 12 board members or

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
whatever. it is, one twelfth of one third more or less.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.000
So i've been kind of playing with this model in my head trying to figure out how to like.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:20.000
I'll allow for investment. Allow for money to come in Give investors, some control, because, indeed, they will promote the survival of this thing, you know.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000
That would be their intention, and and the and the growth of it.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:33.000
You know, and then, but then that's that shouldn't be the end of the you know.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Discussion. No it's just it's just about growth it's just about money.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Sorry. I know you wanna do something good. so too bad I got a good question for you.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Yes, So this is about waiting about. Yeah. and each voter has.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:01.000
And the proposition being voted on, be about this one through one, through one, through division.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Good question and the I. It could be, could potentially be, or it could not be.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:17.000
There was another proposal that I had, which was that depending on the profitability of the company that percentage could change.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:26.000
So if the company was extremely profitable, the amount of say that the shareholders have would shrink.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:32.000
So we would want to keep the the profitability at a certain level.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Enough that the investors get their growth but not enough that they're getting 40 fourx return like they could get some growth, but their amount of say would shrink, depending on how close we were to our goal of profitability of just

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:54.000
enough profitability enough to hey? everybody, you know, not going to debt like not, you know, that kind of thing.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:00.000
And having it like a flexible percentage thing, something like that.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:07.000
What crazy investor would invest in I just don't know.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000
I have no idea, no clue somebody would have to.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:23.000
You should talk to grace rock money aye she's she's raising Her plan is surveys that got off on the amount of money.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Actually she knows a lot about raising money especially in crypto money, which isn't she's not, is not a crypto person, but she's worked with and her plan instantly is an ungodly amount of

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:45.000
money based on Is there? Is there a godly amount of money like?

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Does such a thing exist? Sorry? Good question. also I wonder if you know about

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:58.000
I'm going to put I'm gonna put in notes I'm gonna put Grace grace's name

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Do you know about a thing called slicing the pie or dynamic equity?

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:11.000
You should you should look at those it sounds like what i'm probably like what I've yeah invented in my head.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:19.000
But somebody's already done it. Yeah, they've gone through it and you know, at least you can look at their models, and there's a lot of writing about it.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:34.000
The original great. the original person who wrote the book is slicing the pie, But it's also called dynamic equity, and it answers you kind of get the that idea and then you go Then there's a bunch of questions the

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.000
more important thing is not the solution, but the questions to it.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:57.000
So so then, of course, you've probably heard of dows, and what you're talking about is kind of like a dow too. and Grace would be a good person to talk to about raising money so she's raising

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:08.000
money essentially to like promise to investors is more or less you're going to help fund the commits.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000
And what do I get from that? Well, the capitol funded that's a good thing, right?

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:20.000
What is that? A metaphor is that like a literal Kabuz?

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Maybe kind of both i'm I just just you know like I I my parents were hippies, and like I grew up in this like really slightly dysfunction.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000
But really fun, like really enjoyable community of like draft dodgers.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:55.000
And you know you know, do wells, you know, artists and whatever and like. and I was sort of pulled out of that community very tight community, actually into like public schools and dragged around like school after school, school, by my dad and I have this.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:05.000
like, you know. nostalgic yearning for community and like you know. Yeah, there's a whole lot of the project that i'm interested that I've been iding around around that.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000
But i'm getting another time for what it's worth she did not use that word.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.000
I've invented the word into use for what she's thinking of doing.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:20.000
But it actually kind of fits

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Funding. have you heard of mark tain I don't like hmm.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:47.000
I don't know how I can get you in touch with them, but he's he's trying to an ai that makes money off the stock market, and then use that to fund cool projects like just like put a poke a hole

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
in the beast, and then, like hook it up to like good things.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Yeah, I I highly recommend you who who is that from Jonathan.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:16.000
I didn't mark Kane k a n e he has a thing called Oh, well, old age!

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Oh, fintech it! and there already is another thin tag out there.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.000
So I thought that was like a category of tech.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:35.000
But yeah, yeah, I may have. I may have misunderstood his naming convention.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Okay, but He claims that investors. can receive 200 X and people who you'd have to talk with him about the details. but it's it's well, I think it's a real thing.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000
There are also, I mean, there are a lot of structures.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:15.000
That, you know, involve a for profit that is owned by a nonprofit.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:38.000
And they're like co-ops that are that when you set a third or third, there are co-ops which can be for profit and can be governed by some combination of member users and

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:47.000
and then have board, you know. There, there there are a lot of things very much like what you're talking about.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.000
I'm. i'm I just finished this course by it was funded by the A. A. Rp.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000
It's like startup dot co-op or something like that I thought, Yeah.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
But anyway, start co-op, and I just took their quarters shows you I wasn't totally paying attention.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
But and they have an incubator and i'm a big fan of co-op.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I feel like, for every essential human need, there should never be a for profit.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
It should always be a co-op. I mean cops can be for profit.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:21.000
But you know, but it should be a co-op that runs it, you know.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
And so i'm i'm interested in that and I feel like this.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Software would be a great service to cops where there's already a democratic body or process, or you know the governance is is somehow democratically organized as well.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.000
So yeah, you might also want to join. I mean, you may already know about this.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:57.000
But if you are in the Csc. matter, most there's a channel for the collaborative technology along which yeah, yeah, high low.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And I mean everybody everybody here just about has been at a Cta meeting at one time or another, and it's basically a group of people who were all doing you know what what we're doing.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I mean it, you know it's it's a constant thing of we we actually had a very literal discussion.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:39.000
At the last meeting, which I think among us I might have been the only one at which was tibet from high low was saying, that's great.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Yeah, was saying. Oh, you know we're talking with zebras unite, which is, you know I know them?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Yeah i'm a member of that and we're talking about.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:12.000
They're we're we're talking to them about using high low instead of mighty networks, which is the commercial platform that they're using now and and and we were talking about like basically okay, let's let's be

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:29.000
candid about the reaction of everybody in this meeting to the news that that's happening and doesn't it feel a little bit like, Oh, I wish that had been my platform. And how do we make it so that we create some co-op of

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:39.000
co-ops or co-op of our entities, so that any like positive development for any, any one of us is a good thing for all of us.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:49.000
And so the financial incentives, even even among you know it's like you, come from a world of Ngos, which we were working with a lot.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
The ngos compete with each other it's it's not.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:00.000
It's not all about you know whether it's for profit or of course it's much worse. if you're in a four-profit winner. Take all situation.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:08.000
But you know, cooperation between nonprofits because they're competing for funding from the same foundations.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And and the same public is can be kind of cut throat.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:23.000
And how do you set up the the economies that like make us?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:42.000
You know we we we all talk about the idea that we should be interoperable, and and you know, and and and work together, and that that's the way to scale rather than one of us, you know catching lightning in a

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
bottle, and being the thing that you know does a tick talk to.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:04:03.000
You know, Facebook, and Instagram, and Youtube as opposed to us all, rising as a as a web of of interoperable platforms.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I think ridiculous competition is. how many different remote meeting software store, and how many different chat system, sir.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
And I have I don't know 5 or 6 of them constantly running.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And I often miss things respond to have a date so there's There's there's there's there's these like, I think about this a lot in biological terms anyway.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Practices a doctor for 12 years, saying always in kind of biology mind but like there's there's this ben there's the benefit to competition.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And then there's like the downside of it right and like But the thing is that we're kind of like getting to the point where we have to coordinate past our biological tendencies a little like a little bit you

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:26.000
know like like my son. loves fortnite you know, and I've been playing this shooting game, right, and it's just like you know it. it.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000
It instills the worst, because you land on this place. You just destroy everything you can with a pickaxe.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Shoot everybody you can see you Try and get all the stuff you know, and it's just like no regard for anything.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:46.000
But it's really fun, it's really fun and why is it so fucking fun?

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Why it's the same reason, sweet taste good because it was of benefit to our animal ancestor animal ourselves.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Our Dna, you know, but at some point like to do that, to just go in and take what we could and and like, you know, shoot it.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Anybody that you know disagreed with us and whatever but like we just have to coordinate. We have to learn how to coordinate at another level.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.000
And it'd be great if we could figure out how to do that here.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I mean here we're a bunch of people. you know trying to drink the cooling. We're all sitting around the Coulomb.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
We should be drinking, you know, like or how do we drink this stuff.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You know we're like I mean yeah I mean it'd be great.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
It would be really great for us to figure that I think wendy. You're like, you know.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:48.000
You're explicitly like you know the kool-aid vendor, you know of like coordination in this group, I would say, i'm actually trying to come up with a brand new drink, and see if we can all like put

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
in the ingredients, so that we have something even better.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Yeah, please. Well, I mean, I can just say like you know, I would prefer, you know I prefer a smaller piece of a bigger pie, you know.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:09.000
The problem, though, is, of course, coordination like we all we're all like, you know, visionary.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:16.000
You know. idea. People who are, you know, have, you know? it might be hard to coordinate like it.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And you know, and we might you know otherwise we're gonna try to just out platform each other, or whatever you know like.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Why, and why should we do that like But but then, then again, the process of like hurting the cats into, you know, like something that could be like easy to use, useful like, Maybe not all of these things will fit into something You know they

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.000
might, all the parts might not fit together. Maybe maybe they will, you know.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Maybe they would. But what what would it look like I mean it's It's a it's a challenge, and and it would, I think, probably part of the problem that you guys are facing I can imagine is that you know we only have so much gray matter here we only have

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:16.000
so much attention. We can only focus and we're all focusing on our own thing like i'm i'm like such a cognitive nicer these days, because i'm really trying to get this thing to work and and then for me to

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:23.000
go. Okay, let's put that aside and like let's think about like 6 other parts, And how do those fit together?

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000
And how are we gonna like that's like you're too big Ask like you're asking me to like you know.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Put down the weapon, you know, like Go put out my hand and you know more than that, like you know.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:50.000
It's like Yeah, invest you're asking me to invest in something that sort of feels like it's against my interests in some way, you know.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And yes, if I can interject I I I think one of the keys is that we try to figure out a way that we can come at this, and I and I think in in many ways we have with with specialization in the things that we

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:37.000
each want to focus on. I mean, if you think about the distribution of information and the form of you know, books, documents, Mp: threes, video files, you know, newspapers, email that all basically have common formats that come into

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:47.000
somebody's home and transpose that into a digital space where you think about

01:09:47.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Okay, i'm gonna I have an idea for the way that people who are responding to disasters might want to utilize that.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:21.000
That stuff and organize it. it's sort of like and and and somebody else is like, I have an idea about how people who are just making governance decisions might wanna do that and I have an idea about people who are wanting to

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000
collect old artifacts might want to do that.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:34.000
People who are working with regenerative agriculture, etc., etc. And just like our homes are different and personalized.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:49.000
And we might say, Okay, I want to. have you know an apartment in a big space with a bunch of other people, and we're gonna share the this facility in that. And this other person wants to do this other thing and like I want

01:10:49.000 --> 01:11:01.000
to be stylistically this way, that these kinds of lenses that you can switch between on the same building blocks.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And that this you know we're we're Pete you know.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Takes things down to the level of. You know this is a markdown file.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:21.000
It looks this way. here seems on point to me about like, how do we all agree on the formats in which we can exchange things?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:27.000
The way that email or or image viewing has come to be like you know nobody.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:42.000
It doesn't, if you use like if you have your photos in Hi Cloud, or you have your photos, you know on your hard drive, or whatever it doesn't mean that you can't take one from the other and look at it and

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:52.000
you can't decide. Oh, I think i'm gonna move to you know, to Google for this and whatever I mean it's not It's not a silo.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:09.000
It is a silo. They are competitors but it's not siloed in the same way, and you know figuring out ways that we can work together to provide different lenses even simultaneously on the same stuff like Oh, you know i'd really

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000
like to look at this as you know, a massive wiki or a factor stream, or you know what.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:38.000
How would this on an a mirror board or you know that that let us compete in in certain ways, but that aren't winter take all there are, and that aren't and anti-interoperational right

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:54.000
right. the good the good form of competition. I I would like to comment on your point, Sam, that why don't we coordinate better?

01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And why Can't groups that are doing the same thing just murder?

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:14.000
And my experience as a guy trying to merge here and there and everywhere, is that sometimes the chemistry is right, and sometimes today.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:22.000
And unfortunately that seems to be the prevailing factor.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:35.000
So I do a whole bunch of work thinking this will really help the people, and it's ignore or i'm told it's not time for that yet.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:54.000
So v natural inclination that I have to hey? i'll i'll go underneath what you're doing and support you, and help you lift it up, and the thing i'm lifting is not part of what they're

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:13.000
building, so that's my bad I didn't learn what their timeframe is, or I didn't learn what they're trying to do, and that leads to those descriptions don't often don't exist

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
descriptions what we're trying to do what we're building.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Now what exists here? I see right it's not codified.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
We haven't codified it. Yes, not decided upon

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:46.000
I know a software that can help with that. I love the idea of a needs driven organization that needs driven world. the idea being the well think of advertising.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000
You see a truck with a beautiful babe. Sorry, Wendy.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:12.000
And you think Oh, I want the track just because you know it's shiny and reproductive instinct gets engaged, which is very strong, of course, and that creates a need for a truck on top of all my other

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:29.000
needs and society isn't built to serve my needs it's built to make money and money generates advertising which generates needs nobody really wants

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:42.000
It's, but you know have you ever seen run into nonviolent communication like Yes, one of the needs lists what I mean. But there's no the need it's they they give you funny

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:50.000
strategies for needs They don't give you needs like the babe on the track is not a need.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000
It's a funky strategy, you know for like you know connection.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And like, you know. Yeah, I I some that up by saying most people don't know what their needs are and as a result they have these unfolding needs which drives their emotions.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Those emotions trigger a strategy that does not fill the need.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:27.000
So you know the the upset. The motion is still there.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000
So how alcoholic strength a lot and consumeritis happens.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:52.000
And so if we if we orient towards the needs like the real needs. it might inform the strategies better like. If we're keep an eye on the ball, you know, which is the actual need not the funky strategy and then

01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:00.000
there's, you know, if let's see right now everybody needs money, and it's all they need.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:17.000
And that's it creates all kinds of problems But if we withdrew that need from everybody's need list, they'd be able to focus on getting their needs met

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I I wonder, though for me I feel like the the the the problem.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:29.000
So the money is like the the universal exchange media, you know.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And if you focus on that, you might do silly things.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000
But if you learn how to focus on the needs, then the you know, we can figure out different exchange media.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:49.000
We can figure out different ways of like you know managing the flow of resources right like It's it's a it's a resource flow thing.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:18:02.000
But like like we're we're missing the the like we're, you know, my team of our teachers say don't pick up the sesame seed and forget the water mound like we're we're missing

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:18.000
the thing like the real thing. which is the needs you know the the real needs for connection, for you know safety for you know long term feeling good about like you know the path we're on, and and we're you know how our future generations

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.000
are gonna you know what the going to inherit and you know they're all this stuff, all this like real stuff.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Yeah. And yeah, we're just focused on the exchange current media and totally ignoring the actual needs.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Yeah, I just I guess my point here, is hey? you're totally right.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:52.000
And yes, but people are distracted bye that need for profit.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Even if all their needs are met, they still need more money.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:13.000
So that's only one problem among many But I figure if to your statement, if if we focused on our needs and we looked at strategies for getting filled, we'd be better off.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.000
And my counterpoint to that is, how are you gonna convince them?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:25.000
And on I I don't know the answer and I Well, I only have one extremely crazy.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
I should be taken up behind the barn shots.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Get rid of money What are we with what What are we replacing with that's the 64 million dollar question like a time bank or something or like What

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Benefit to anybody increases your wealth if you create it well.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:19.000
But well again, you're talking about some kind of a measure, right right. But instead of basing money on services rendered or or mind from a mountain right, you you do it in terms of benefit to the the world terms, some

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:29.000
mining like you could have a currency that's called like I call it regard feel good Yeah, regard Yeah, that's a good one.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Yeah like, I say, drag me up behind the barn yeah That's that's not a bad idea at all. Jonathan having an exchange.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Economy is is kind of the problem yeah it's it's so hard to like It's it's this thing of exchange is integral, though it's like it's in biology.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000
It's like you know. glucose you know the universal fuel, you know.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
You get too much of it. You get diabetes you know you don't get enough.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
You die, You know it's like how do you how do you How do you?

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:21.000
How do you manage the exchange? of energy you know of of of of how do you coordinate work without someone's? Here's Here's your bread?

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:27.000
You know. here's your salt for the day you know like yeah, it's it's yep, it's a time.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000
It's a tough nut to crack that's exactly what i'm experiencing.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:44.000
They're all kinds of problems with a regard based economy. I I want people who are smarter than me to help.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I I just I I would I Yeah, I would love to see that problem solved.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Also I I feel like maybe it can be solved like other ways like maybe the the exchange medium can like become something that's secondary to the the coordination practice of coordination that's happening like it can be

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:18.000
like operating it could be managed as as as a a substrate.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:28.000
That's not the focus anymore, you know, somehow but it's still like there's some way of saying, Okay, you did you know you you did a lot of work, you or you you know.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:36.000
You contributed, and you made a difference here. You did this, you know you, you know you dug the ditch, or whatever you know like that this exchange happens.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:45.000
But but that somehow we transcend the focus on that thing we're getting pretty physical software.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:53.000
But I it it is about that it's ultimately about what you're saying yep there's time bank issues.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:01.000
There's. What's that time to go when Wendy's leaving Yep I don't have to go soon, too.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:09.000
But I was going to I was gonna suggest, or at well first ask, Have you read the dawn of everything?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I am reading it. I I was gonna and and sam too. just in terms of sauce.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:33.000
It's awesome yeah, and and your thoughts about the necessity of money and and different media of exchange kick in the ass.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And look at examples of societal structures yeah it's an ioener very valuable eye opener.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Interesting. Yeah, i'll check it out

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I I I guess it's it's 1130 pm here, so I should probably get jump off to you.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.000
But i'm in amsterdam Netherlands cool cool.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I still wanted to do one on one with you. Man, how do I do that?

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:18.000
I have like a link where you can look at my account And do you just link on the with that, although there's been problems with that Sp.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Will a test, or you just just ping me wherever the pinging is happening, and i'll send you my email you guys wanna set up something right now not in there.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Do you know how to add a hack amid in the heck of do?

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I'll put it in there. I don't care i've got a jump great to meet you.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Nice to look to talk to you share my my experiences, and maybe of use sounds like we've had some a little bit of a similar path.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.000
And it's good i'm looking forward to it nice to meet everybody. Oh, i'll put my hab like a scheduler.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Yeah, I can't vouch, to it's I wouldn't recommend it right? i'm sorry we didn't connect earlier today, yeah, even though I I think we're due to meeting 28 min But

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Yeah, maybe not. Yeah. But I sent you an email with the emails I got.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.000
You might want to look at them. Okay, okay, I don't know if that'll help or not.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000
But it might Yeah. might help me figure out why it's not working correctly.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:56.000
So I put together a list. So one of the things that catalyst does is lets you create like a collection like a curated collection of different objects.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:02.000
So I made this one after hearing like talking about like How do we actually create, like the right structure for new startups.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
And it's funny because I put I was like putting in zebras.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:12.000
United and the start co-op, and then those are mentioned in the call, like a few minutes after I put them in here.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And I was like game. It beat me to it slicing my I put exit community, which is an interesting concept.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:29.000
If you haven't heard of it I I know of it. Yeah, I do like it. Where you you re buy the equity of the yeah Yeah. Yeah. platform.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Dot co-op is also a pretty good looked into them.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Yeah, for sure anyways, i'll share this with you in case you want to help it out in the hack, I need to do more of this like all of my stuff is in random like up city and documents and stuff.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000
and it seems like a nice way to kind of group.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Oh, I want to align the concepts So Hmm.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Okay, for what's worth the way that we use the Hackham D.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Is to write on it and then move it all into an obsidian, which will then get published to the web.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Okay, so we don't usually keep stuff on an on a Hackham.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Do you like this? What web will you put this on?

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I will leave it here for a while. The flotilla notes go into the flotilla.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Wiki which doesn't get published to the web unlike most of them.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:41.000
It just ends up accumulating in github We don't have a web front end to it. i'm but I really want i'm like there's a part.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Of me that's really rooting for figuring out how to integrate all this stuff. I don't know what it would look like.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Yeah, but I think like Wow, be interesting. that's my area of expertise.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:12.000
By the way, Okay, and how to navigate it I think I think it's a very hard problem. it's. It's not my area of expertise. I designed that whole Web the whole Forb thing like I design the whole

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:23.000
thing you can tell it's not me I mean I I borrowed some ideas from people I had somebody do some design very at the very beginning, and then it just morphed and you know I just ran by it but anyway.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:29.000
So i'd be very happy to to hear your take on things very, very, and we had to do that.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:42.000
So that's something. I do Okay,
