## Project Clambake

- [flotilla] Project Clambake channel](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/flotilla-project-clambake)

Clambake is testing out the merger of a dynamic mapping UI, robust web content curation, and powerful project hub to create a knowledge platform that connects people with the information and opportunities at the right time, in the right place and in the right way.

Another way it's been described: like [[Emergent Event Sensemaking]], but about longer-term things, rather than in-the-moment events.

## Other 

weekly meetings, "open house"/"office hours" meetings

Next Tuesday, come hear the latest on how the Internet Archive and Starling Labs are forging paths through decentralized storage:  https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dweb-meetup-september-2021-preserving-humanitys-greatest-assets-tickets-168352156833
