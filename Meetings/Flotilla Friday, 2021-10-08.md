## What Flotilla Is Thinking About

- we need a Flotilla website
    - Pete, Michael
- we need a static site for the Flotilla Wiki
    - Pete
- we like interoperability! (what does that mean?)
- we want to try syndicating data more
    - Person profile between Trove, Factr, Massive Wiki
- Project Clambake (what's that?)
- we should talk more about what Flotilla is and isn't

## Ideas For Topics

- Hyperknowledge meetings, Tuesdays 10am PT
- Collaborative knowledge / collective knowledge
- Vincent collaborative event curation updates
- Wendy McLean updates on my project of weaving a knowledge network
- Mark - are ads ok?
- suggestion about collaborative knowledge vs meeting notes.
    - agree that we should have some sort of overall notes/current state of the system
- 2 most useful repo items for me: video recording posted, notes with take-away or next steps to help guide our next meeting
-

## Collaborative Knowledge

- meeting notes
- need a current state of the system
- different kinds of artifacts
- cost of getting transcription accurate enough for sensemaking
- Flows vs stocks
- collaborative wiki-ing
    - e.g., 1 shared computer for Obsidian and HackMD, using screen sharing (VNC), and HackMD for additional people who are single-tracking through VNC
- https://demo.idealoom.org

[[Vincent Arena]]

> i saw the chat rant and i enjoyed it :D

Peter Kaminski

> :D

> "colonizers"

[[Mark Carranza]]

> Vernor Vinge

Vincent Arena

> one person doing the work - is that because everyone has their own tool?

> i think the real question is: what will make others use the tools we use?

[[Marc-Antoine Parent]]

> Vincent probably....

[[Wendy McLean, NY]]

> +1 Vincent

Vincent Arena

> I’d like to share some collaborative event curation updates :D

Wendy McLean, NY

> I’d like to share updates on my project of weaving a knowledge network

Mark Carranza

> I have a use of Trove question, - friends are starting a company consulting to non-profit sustainable organizations

> Ar ads for “commercial service”

> Are ads — ok?

Vincent Arena

> Mark - great question…. i have an interesting answer for that

[[BentleyDavis.com]]

> I have a suggestion about collaborative knowledge vs meeting notes.

Vincent Arena

> tuesday 10am PST - what is the meeting??

Wendy McLean, NY

> 2 most useful repo items for me: video recording posted, notes with take-away or next steps to help guide our next meeting

[[Jack Park]]

> @Wendy +1 on knowledge weaving

Peter Kaminski

> can somebody grab the topic suggestions here and put them on hackmd

Vincent Arena

> I agree that we should use the end of the meeting to catalog/record/organize….

Jack Park

> Athens claims they are about to announce a collaborative version - which would give you the power of Roam in an online platform for meetings

Vincent Arena

> added the topics into the notes :D

Peter Kaminski

> thanks vincent!

Jack Park

> Athens and Obsidian are in pretty much the same space, though Athens is OSS. Obsidian is much more refined.

> Flow and curation!! +1 @Wendy

Mark Carranza

> “Duty paralyzes spontaneity”

Marc-Antoine Parent

> athens is only partly OSS, iirc

Wendy McLean, NY

> Yes Pete! I’m saying it’s a dance. Both are important

> Slowing down to sense make and allowing the flow of conversation to happen as needed

Marc-Antoine Parent

> the other option is to have rhythmic breaks to alternate between fast and slow. Of course that also takes discipline.

Mark Carranza

> VNC?

Marc-Antoine Parent

> screen sharing solution

BentleyDavis.com

> VNC: Virtual Network Computer. Allows you to control someone elses pc.

Marc-Antoine Parent

> yes screen sharing and control

Jack Park

> https://tigervnc.org/

Mark Carranza

> Changing human behavior

> — our own

> Is hard but can be fun

[[Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com]]

> A possible experiment: Say we chop up the video of this meeting, roughly per speaker (problematic I know, due to crosstalk and interaction) and tag it. With tags (some of which Mark is generating), even if not that this group of granular segments can be searched —better and better—by a.) speaker, b.) subject(s) c.) time d.) links mentioned, e.) whatever else. Then comments can be made on those individual segments, so discussion can be expanded upon, one-off quotes can be quoted by those for whom they are notable, speakers can elaborate or clarify (or recant!) links can be added, etc.

Vincent Arena

> question: what do we want to see as outputs? what do others want to see?

Peter Kaminski

> i'm currently using TightVNC on the windows server, and either the built-in Mac viewer (for ease of getting started) or the RealVNC viewer.

Wendy McLean, NY

> Do you mind stopping your share? I’d love to see people better.

Peter Kaminski

> np, thank you for asking :-)

Wendy McLean, NY

> +1 Vincent

Mark Carranza

> The way archive.org does TV news:

> https://archive.org/details/BBCNEWS_20181020_213000_The_Papers/start/588/end/648?q=bentley+davis

Peter Kaminski

> Thanks @Michael. In my mind, the thing to do is to pause every 5-10 minutes, and then have one or several people mindmap (maybe visually, or maybe in a wiki) what was just discussed, in a way that everyone can see the map.

Mark Carranza

> … by clip + transcript

Vincent Arena

> bring your kid to flotilla day next week?

Peter Kaminski

> possible output: a glossary

Mark Carranza

> It’s experimental, and we are developing a new context — as shared — and it will take time

Peter Kaminski

> the output i'd want is a group memory and group thinking/conversation space, in a wiki

Mark Carranza

> Any new medium needs time to be assimilated '

Wendy McLean, NY

> +1 Vincent

Vincent Arena

> https://www.catalist.network/group/flotilla?tab=Opportunities

BentleyDavis.com

> Pete, can you create a hack MD for the next meeting so we can prep/agenda for next meeting?

Vincent Arena

> my personal pain points and things id want for an output of a group memory: i want to highlight a piece of a youtube video and save it for later. i want to add quick notes. i want to “do later” on a link someone shared….. i want to be able to bring together multiple peoples notes in different formats so i can see them without asking them a year later. i want to be able to easily find anything related to a past event on any device in less than 5 steps.

Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com

Vincent Arena

Peter Kaminski

Vincent Arena

> tags have to be manually added? or can it be autoamted?

Peter Kaminski

> manual curation (and you could add automated, too, but manual would be the big value add)

BentleyDavis.com

Vincent Arena
