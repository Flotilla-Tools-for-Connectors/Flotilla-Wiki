00:08:45	Mark Carranza:	AAK: Annotating All Knowledge
00:10:18	Bill Anderson:	mc: a newer alternative to hypothes.is: https://getmemex.com/
00:10:45	Mark Carranza:	November DWeb video not up yet. Will poke.
00:10:46	Bill Anderson:	i have been on hypothes.is for many years
00:10:59	Jack Park:	hypothes.is is well-positioned to do something like AAK
00:13:03	Mark Carranza:	Not a big fan of memex.garden so far. I like Oliver Sauter, met him several times
00:18:46	Mark Carranza:	The measure of uncertainty?
00:19:14	Mark Carranza:	Love a concept map of ‚Äúentropy‚Äù!!!
00:20:19	Mark Carranza:	What‚Äôs in a name?
00:21:40	Jack Park:	Poirot: ‚Äúlittle gray cells‚Äù
00:22:28	Bill Anderson:	legendary conversations
00:26:18	Mark Carranza:	Something went by too fast, but I‚Äôll listen to the recording ‚Äî as Pete gets it out
00:26:54	Mark Carranza:	Is there something visually we can point to about topic map legends?

00:31:39	Vincent Arena:	Good timing on joining Wendy üòÑ
00:32:10	Vincent Arena:	Also, Pete: do you see all the different zoom settings on the bottom? Hosting a conference on Saturday with this account so I turned on breakout rooms üòÑ
00:32:36	Wendy McLean, NY:	Yes!  So glad I‚Äôm here to hear this!
00:33:08	CSC Zoom:	I see the breakout room button, and 3 ‚ÄúLive on ‚Ä¶‚Äù items in the three-dot menu
00:33:29	CSC Zoom:	And polls/quizzes
00:34:59	Bill Anderson:	an older, related exploration is in this 1989 paper from Bill Kent: Anderson, William (2013): WKent: The many forms of a single fact.. figshare. Poster. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.156473.v1
00:35:42	Bill Anderson:	the one ring to rule them all
00:35:46	CSC Zoom:	Upper ontology, _and_ umbrella as a verb! :-)
00:35:54	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Bill
00:38:37	CSC Zoom:	Speaking of engineers, a nice cover of Peggy Seeger‚Äôs song ‚ÄúI'm Gonna Be an Engineer‚Äù, by Reina Del Cid.‚Ä®‚Ä®https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7_jhpvsFrM‚Ä®‚Ä®(more about sexism than engineering. Although not many songs have ‚Äúturret lathe‚Äù in the lyrics‚Ä¶)
00:39:45	Bill Anderson:	CSC Zoom +100 on the Reina del Cid cover of Peggy Seegar‚Äôs song
00:40:20	CSC Zoom:	Yikes! I haven‚Äôt changed my name. Fixing now‚Ä¶
00:42:03	Peter Kaminski:	Conceptual Revolutions
Book by Paul Thagard
00:42:43	Peter Kaminski:	"Thagard examines the Copernican and the Darwinian revolutions and the emergence of Newton‚Äôs mechanics, Lavoisier‚Äôs oxygen theory, Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity, quantum theory, and the geological theory of plate tectonics. He discusses the psychological mechanisms by which new concepts and links between them are formed, and advances a computational theory of explanatory coherence to show how new theories can be judged to be superior to previous ones."

A violence, the author argues, even well-intentioned environmental science and activism can reproduce. In this first of two episodes featuring the author, we discuss how the world became awash in plastics, with part two dedicated to how we might better grasp and grapple with the larger forces producing this toxic legacy.‚Ä®‚Ä®"Pollution is Colonialism": Part Two (ep 259)‚Ä®https://mediaindigena.libsyn.com/pollution-is-colonialism-part-two-ep-259‚Ä®‚Ä®"in the back half of this extended conversation, we find out why Land is not so much a noun as it is a verb, and why anti-colonial is not the same as de-colonial, especially when it comes to methods for pollution science, methods which foreground values of humility, equity, and good land relations."

00:51:41	Peter Kaminski:	L'acteur et le systeme
Book by Erhard Friedberg and Michel Crozier
00:51:58	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Yes that one
00:52:19	Peter Kaminski:	Don't make me think is actually Steve Krug‚Ä®‚Ä®Don Norman is The Design of Everyday Things and others.
00:53:09	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Translated as ‚ÄúActors and Systems‚Äù

00:54:56	Marc-Antoine Parent:	On feminist history of science: I mentioned https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Fox_Keller
00:59:30	Bill Anderson:	standards, formal and not, do slow down innovation. but they can enhance usability.
01:02:17	Jack Park:	gotta run
01:02:17	Marc-Antoine Parent:	That‚Äôs recent-ish, actually. I remember the early UX standards by Apple‚Ä¶ they wanted their computers to be usable, not to advertise for someone else.
01:03:11	Peter Kaminski:	this was reasonably early, too: Amiga User Interface Style Guide : Commodore-Amiga Inc. : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive https://archive.org/details/amiga-user-interface-style-guide
01:03:20	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Who‚Äôs the target audience? If it does not match the user, you‚Äôre indeed in trouble.

01:05:07	Bill Anderson:	20-30 years from early Xerox PARC work on video-based work to today‚Äôs Zoom ++
01:06:13	Vincent Arena:	Artisanship in software
01:06:33	Vincent Arena:	Is Modern cookie-cutter architecture akin to google material design?
01:06:38	Vincent Arena:	Or is it just ‚Äúthe best‚Äù?
01:08:14	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Material design was such an interesting mix of very useful well-motivated form and pretty glitzy not-so useful form‚Ä¶ more of the former, but still.
01:09:33	Marc-Antoine Parent:	I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe best‚Äù, but it‚Äôs the current local optimum in the fitness landscape‚Ä¶ where familiarity of a common interface is a constraint, and sales are a constraint.
01:09:52	Vincent Arena:	Iterate at scale (in terms of users) but also scale in terms of data?
01:10:04	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Exactly Pete. Automated AB testing is a great way to get to a local optimum.
01:10:30	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Which is not to say that there‚Äôs no space for major innovations outside of the local optimum.
01:10:54	Bill Anderson:	engineers do like the statistics tools
01:11:44	Wendy McLean, NY:	Agree that maps are not something easy for everyone, and meta / layered maps are even fewer people.  However, more people COULD than do.  If it provides enough benefit, reduce friction, increase connection, people learn.
01:12:23	Bill Anderson:	wendy ++
01:12:34	Marc-Antoine Parent:	indeed
01:12:42	Wendy McLean, NY:	People used to know how to read street maps because it was essential, now they just use GPS so fewer people (younger set) know how to read a map.  Doesn‚Äôt mean they couldn‚Äôt easily learn.
01:13:26	Bill Anderson:	i agree with the ‚Äúeasily learn‚Äù point
01:14:13	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Can you give the paper url?

01:14:30	Marc-Antoine Parent:	thanks!
01:14:33	Vincent Arena:	Also on trove if you want to edit/add to it üòÑ
01:15:05	Peter Kaminski:	one of my favorite explanations of local optima is by Neal Stephenson, Space stasis: What the strange persistence of rockets can teach us about innovation. https://slate.com/technology/2011/02/space-stasis-what-the-strange-persistence-of-rockets-can-teach-us-about-innovation.html
01:16:53	Peter Kaminski:	_and_, https://www.spinlaunch.com/ is doing launches that aren't just bigger and bigger chemical rockets
01:20:28	Wendy McLean, NY:	So important Marc-Antoine, yes!  BOTH familiarity and designing for flow are important
