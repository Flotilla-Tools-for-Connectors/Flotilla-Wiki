# Flotilla Friday, 2021-04-09

## Possible Agenda Items
- calendar update
- massive wiki update
- journaling thread from CICOLAB
- getting attendees connected to Flotilla Wiki
- creating directory pages in OGM Wiki
- a (Catalist-Flotilla-Massive Wiki) templates meeting someday

## Calendar Update
- what would be a good MVP for OGM and CICOLAB and similar clusters?
- where should the data flow out to?
- what are our user personas?
    - Community Admins
    - Community Members
- use cases
    - As a Community Admin, I want people to rsvp for an event (or add it to their calendar) so I can see how many people are likely to attend a particular event, and so I will have their email addresses handy for post-meeting contact
    - I can't find the zoom link for the event that's starting right now
    - I want to found out what other events exist in my (org cluster) that I might want to attend
    - I want an automated alert of events that match with my profile interests that I previously didn't know about
        - I want to be able to automatically RSVP to one of these newly-found events by clicking on something in the alert
    - As a Community Admin, I want to have a "profile page" for an event that collects links to meeting artifacts
    - As a Community Member, I want to be able to find events and their meeting artifacts
        - That I attended
        - That I haven't attended but find interesting
    - As a Community Member, I want to get a reminder of an event that's coming up in 24 hours.
        - In a mattermost channel.
        - In a direct email to me.
        - As a text message / Telegram message / WhatsApp / Facebook message

Where to find things:
* Mattermost/Discord/Slack (links sent)
* Google Calendar (the stuff THERE)
* Catalist Community Page (Open)
* Catalist Community Page (Closed)
* Catalist Network Page (Open/Closed)
* Catalist Public Events?
* Text/Email
* 
## Linking Organizations

- by working style
- by temperament
