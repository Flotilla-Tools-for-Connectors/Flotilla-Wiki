# Flotilla Friday, 2021-03-12

## Experiments

### non-Webflow

* firebase 
* flutter (bleah)
* bubble (yay!)

### Link Catalog

* Airtable
* Telegram bot
* idea: 'stripminer' script, to mine archives

#### Syntax

* :type:
  * like emojis in chat systems :-)
* #topic
* https://barelink.example.com/
  * has to start with https or www

## Massive Wiki

### Demo / Diagram

### Git (protocol, hubs, etc.)

* git the protocol / tool
  * decentralized / peer-to-peer
* hubs: GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, gittea, etc.

## Flotilla

### Federation/Syndication/Murmuration-ish Stuff

* really important
* Massive and [federated document creation and revision](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/ji61en34yfnn9g1ge5mdwj7hyw) is cool
* looks like we should get tools up first, then work on syndication/aggregation
* Massive-Catalist coordination
  * Vincent and Pete to stay in close touch going forward
    * "leaf" schemas from Catalist to help set up wiki page templates
    * URL structure / format of wiki pages (both wiki-specific, and semantics/information architecture of directory wikis) for Catalist to interoperate

### Catalist Status

* switching tech for scalability, but usable now at reasonable scale
* other app named "Catalist" (Likewise copycat)

### Directories Editability Prioritization

* self-edit vs. admin edit
* scope ("tag") to community
* timeframe
* amount of facilitation
* dev effort
* hard costs (e.g., Airtable Pro)

### Directories Rollout / Facilatation

* documentation
* 1- or 2-minute how-to videos
* demonstration / help meetings
* barn raisings
* "customer support" / helpdesk / facilitation team

### OGM Needs Directories/Dashboard

* people
* projects / quests
* guilds
* dashboard

Let's try to do both Catalist and Massive together.

### New Idea: Agreements Hub

* new Flotilla product quest
* 2-way agreements
* multiple-party agreements
* CICOLAB MOU quest---

# Flotilla Friday, 2021-04-02

## Agenda

- calendar
- free-form profile/directory pages on OGM Wiki
- should we have a Flotilla massive wiki?

## Calendar

- Airtable multi-sync -- two-way sync with multiple Google calendars
    - = federated Google calendars, viewable on Catalist

### Functionality
- very quickly input data into shared calendar
- handle various events at various levels of openness and privacy
    - findability / friction (more or less depending on what you want)
    - knowing the intentionality of setting up and publishing your event
- being able to update events

### Testing and Getting Feedback
- easy way to get people to use it and get feedback

### Make Calendar a First-Class Project
- how to resource it?
- Pete's sharing picture of architectural "secret sauce" - [Slack notifications flowchart](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ZGZ9a-m8yNrliqppeU1qJg.jpeg)

### Resourcing

- say there's a straw budget need for first six months (dev, design, marketing) = $250k at retail salaries
- pay half that for "non-profit" pricing?
- sweat equity?  (but need a revenue model for that)
- hybrid commercial / commons model?
    - inspiration: Alex + Internet Archive
- wordpress model?
    - open source software
    - preferred service vendor makes revenue
- b2b product?
    - revenue comes from managing private business events
    - data commons, stewarded by catalist
    - like github, if it's open it's free

## Other companies

- calendly
- eventbrite
- woven---

# Flotilla Friday, 2021-04-09

## Possible Agenda Items
- calendar update
- massive wiki update
- journaling thread from CICOLAB
- getting attendees connected to Flotilla Wiki
- creating directory pages in OGM Wiki
- a (Catalist-Flotilla-Massive Wiki) templates meeting someday

## Calendar Update
- what would be a good MVP for OGM and CICOLAB and similar clusters?
- where should the data flow out to?
- what are our user personas?
    - Community Admins
    - Community Members
- use cases
    - As a Community Admin, I want people to rsvp for an event (or add it to their calendar) so I can see how many people are likely to attend a particular event, and so I will have their email addresses handy for post-meeting contact
    - I can't find the zoom link for the event that's starting right now
    - I want to found out what other events exist in my (org cluster) that I might want to attend
    - I want an automated alert of events that match with my profile interests that I previously didn't know about
        - I want to be able to automatically RSVP to one of these newly-found events by clicking on something in the alert
    - As a Community Admin, I want to have a "profile page" for an event that collects links to meeting artifacts
    - As a Community Member, I want to be able to find events and their meeting artifacts
        - That I attended
        - That I haven't attended but find interesting
    - As a Community Member, I want to get a reminder of an event that's coming up in 24 hours.
        - In a mattermost channel.
        - In a direct email to me.
        - As a text message / Telegram message / WhatsApp / Facebook message

Where to find things:
* Mattermost/Discord/Slack (links sent)
* Google Calendar (the stuff THERE)
* Catalist Community Page (Open)
* Catalist Community Page (Closed)
* Catalist Network Page (Open/Closed)
* Catalist Public Events?
* Text/Email
*

 - Discuss

https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/ht9a5yucdifw8ja8jai7njsb4c

Catalist is a guild/organization/group that I think wants to eventually have a community and be a broader collection of tools/products, potentially be a cooperative of many tools. 

Trove is a focused product, the first product that has come out of the catalist ecosystem. It’s a directory system for communities that combines elements of knowledge management tools with a social component (the vision is Reddit meets federated wiki for groups and networks)


- Zero Friction Community formation

Progressive accounts
People bring their own profiles
connect peer to peer
transclude/link to their own massive wike and other content


## Branding / Collaboration / Community Marks

Chris Messina's "Community Marks"

- [The Case for Community Marks](https://factoryjoe.com/2006/01/14/the-case-for-community-marks/)
- [Why BarCamp is a Community Mark](https://factoryjoe.com/2006/05/29/why-barcamp-is-a-community-mark/)

### Design Systems

- MIT Media Lab, https://www.pentagram.com/work/mit-media-lab/story

How might we have a design system that collaborating sovereigns might use together?
- logos
- colors
- typography
- structural naming
- "a tool for connecting"

# Flotilla Friday, 2021-05-28

## Agenda

- integrating massive wiki and trove
- token curated registries
- SourceCred
- LinkSDG
- Coalition of Sovereigns
- brain-computer interface
- AI (ML)-driven 
- Ben Roberts
- http://www.open-atlas.org/
- John Vervaeke's lecture series “Awakening from the Meaning Crisis” (0:49)
- \_uprtcl


## AI, BCI, etc.

"Crossing the postmodern divide"
Book by Albert Borgmann
- hyperactive vs. despondent
    - and wise?

wisdom
- at the embodied level (0:30)

augmentation + inequality
- capital
- knowledge

augmented human networks vs. the borg

build stuff not in capitalist, accretive system

wisdom not enough
- grounded in land, local
- links between local
- grounded yet connected
    - without erasure

## Commons and Governance

- Generative Commons
- Dietz, P., Ostrom, E., & Stern, Paul C., "The Struggle to Govern the Commons", Science 12 December 2003:  Vol. 302 no. 5652 pp. 1907-1912, DOI: 10.1126/science.1091015
- Linked Open Wisdom Commons

- epistemological commons
- ontological commons (ways of being)

- propositional knowledge
- modes of existence

- progressive partial formalization
    - alignment without (some) formalization is usually a mess; BUT, never wait for full formalization (it's asymptotic)

what we have discovered, and who has connections to that (0:43)

## Flotilla

09:59:17 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : the four sides to every story: your side, my side, the truth, and what really happened
10:00:45 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : I’m seeing the need for another tool that works with massive wiki to work through branching and integration. Thinking about SourceCred on Discourse forums for the dialectic process. Source of truth ie wiki represents the emergent consensus of the branches.
10:01:04 From Marc-Antoine Parent to Everyone : Benjamin we really should talk...
10:02:41 From vincent arena to Everyone : sorry everyone dealing with some issues right now have to run. have fun!

# Flotilla Friday, 2021-06-25 

## Interoperability

- mapping objects between systems
- start with "thick" objects or "thin" objects

Factr's streams hold artifacts.

### Syndication Communication Channels
- API pull
- RSS feed
- something like [pingbacks / trackbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback)
    - [Pingback 1\.0](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback) (2002)

### Objects

- Person
    - Profiles
    - Identity for signing in
    - Social identity
    - Affiliation with other entities
- Organization
- Event
- Web URL (as lightweight resource; i.e., a bookmark)

How to disambiguate persons?
- how to decentralize (and coordinate) IDs?
    - [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) (W3C)
- Keybase as an example: using online artefacts as representations of me; and others can use them to make a judgement about the particular ID used.
    - "Keybase is a key directory that maps social media identities to encryption keys (including, but not limited to PGP keys) in a publicly auditable manner."
    - open source sigchains and user proofs: [keys\.pub](https://keys.pub/)

00:38:36, Peter Kaminski: @Bill, which part of Keybase?

00:38:47, Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com: +1 Bill Exactly, we’re all about the artifactrs!

00:43:43, Bill Anderson: keybase: using online artefacts as representations of me; and others can use them to make a judgement about the particular ID used (e.g., for me “band”)

00:44:41, Peter Kaminski: thanks, Bill :-)

00:44:47, vincent arena: placed with force

00:44:52, Phil Kennedy: hahaha

09:02:22 From CSC Zoom to Everyone : https://hackmd.io/@peterkaminski/r1EupmyCu
09:10:55 From Mark Carranza to Everyone : Hi and bye !
09:18:07 From CSC Zoom to Everyone : i like Vincent's fractal vision here, _and_, I would love to see a gallery of fractal scales.  in my previous call, we were looking at the fractal scales of biology from mitochondria, single-celled orgs, multicellular orgs, up to complex organisms like worms and dogs and humans -- and then fractal levels of social structures -- tribes, villages, cities, nations, multinational corps, etc.
09:18:46 From CSC Zoom to Everyone : another fractal scale is (i think) mandelbrot's example of coastlines, all the way from grains of sand to a whole coastline
09:31:57 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : https://savvycal.com/
09:32:39 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : the savvycal site has comparisons with:  Calendly
YouCanBook.me
Acuity Scheduling
Meetingbird
Doodle
Woven
X.ai
09:37:09 From Wendy McLean to Everyone : I like the balance too. Interesting to learn when it gets more technical
09:49:01 From Wendy McLean to Everyone : I’m picturing facebooks posting features
09:49:08 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : yep
09:58:33 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : Annie Murphy Paul - The Extended Mind
10:07:26 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : "The Extended Mind - The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain" book by Annie Murphy Paul  (just reposting Bill, but in a format a parser of the future will pick up as a book :-))
10:08:03 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : and also a website:  https://anniemurphypaul.com/books/the-extended-mind/
10:08:10 From vincent arena to Everyone : Wendy and I spoke with tom!
10:09:19 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : "... but they are limited by their assumption that thinking happens only inside the brain. Much less attention has been paid to the ways in which people use the world to think: the gestures of the hands, the space of a sketchbook, the act of listening to someone tell a story or the task of teaching someone else. These “extra-neural” inputs change the way we think; it could even be said that they constitute a part of the thinking process itself. "
10:14:32 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : https://band.trinket.io/scientific-data-informatics#/scientific-data-informatics/data-is-information
10:20:32 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : concept mapping can help with this, Pete

- sibling of Distributed Directory Project?

Some design questions:

* What is a project?
* Who speaks for it?
    * "ambassador" vs. "leader", "leadership"
    * "leaderless"
    * in group dynamics there is a vocab of distributing authority such as ambassadors, decision makers, observers, plenipotentiary, etc.
* How do they keep the directory entry updated?
* How does it syndicate more detail (project roadmap, task list, resources needed)
    * Into the directory?
    * Into the world?
* How do people know how to find the directory?
* How do people know how to use the directory?

## Project Clambake

- [flotilla] Project Clambake channel](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/flotilla-project-clambake)

Clambake is testing out the merger of a dynamic mapping UI, robust web content curation, and powerful project hub to create a knowledge platform that connects people with the information and opportunities at the right time, in the right place and in the right way.

Another way it's been described: like [[Emergent Event Sensemaking]], but about longer-term things, rather than in-the-moment events.

## Other 

weekly meetings, "open house"/"office hours" meetings

Next Tuesday, come hear the latest on how the Internet Archive and Starling Labs are forging paths through decentralized storage:  https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dweb-meetup-september-2021-preserving-humanitys-greatest-assets-tickets-168352156833

09:33:25	 From Jack Park : which did not mention Engelbart’s Unfinished Revolution

09:36:13	 From Jack Park : google ‘unfinished revolution engelbart’
09:37:11	 From Peter Kaminski : Neurophysiologist William Calvin, who has an explanation (theory?) of how thought work, uses "chorus" in his explanation.  (Also natural selection, happening on top of competing choruses.)

09:38:42	 From Mark Carranza : Speech act event queues?
09:38:54	 From Peter Kaminski : "Newly-cloned patterns are tacked onto a temporary mosaic, much like a choir recruiting additional singers during the Hallelujah Chorus. But cloning may “blunder slightly” or overlap several patterns — and that variation makes us creative. Like dueling choirs, variant hexagonal mosaics compete with one another for territory in the association cortex, their success biased by memorized environments and sensory inputs."
09:39:11	 From Jerry Michalski : ooooo, mosaics and choruses. music to my ears
09:40:01	 From Mark Carranza : Meme streams
09:40:04	 From Mark Carranza : Idea streams

09:44:20	 From Peter Kaminski : "faux friend"
09:44:27	 From Mark Carranza : The _illusion_ of clear categories
09:44:36	 From Peter Kaminski : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend
09:45:22	 From Jerry Michalski : Ship of Theseus (aka Theseus' Paradox) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus
09:45:43	 From Mark Carranza : To do it at need
09:45:53	 From Peter Kaminski : progressive, partial formalization
09:47:21	 From Peter Kaminski : web URLs = identifier for a mutable object IPFS = identifier for immutable object (content-addressed) how about an identifier to a history of versions of an object
09:47:30	 From Mark Carranza : Media Field & Stream
09:47:42	 From Jerry Michalski : is that like Mane & Tail?
09:48:23	 From Mark Carranza : https://www.fieldandstream.com/survival/massachusetts-beaver-attack/
09:48:58	 From Peter Kaminski : (the hack for IPFS to point to a mutable object with history is IPNS, https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipns/#example-ipns-setup-with-cli
09:50:10	 From Bill Anderson : i can understand what we want to do. what is it for?
09:51:30	 From Peter Kaminski : can we federate the work of debunking, explaining, etc.?
09:52:07	 From Peter Kaminski : streams, distributed index of streams, concept neighborhoods
09:53:02	 From Peter Kaminski : negotiated identity, rather than (the illusion of) stable identity
09:53:57	 From Peter Kaminski : listicles as a knowledge structure, a semantic layer above listicles
09:54:17	 From Jerry Michalski : this’ll be fun to do as GANs automatically generate zillions of slightly modified arguments 🙂
09:54:24	 From Wendy McLean, NY : @bill, for me it goes back to the example I gave of how a teacher would use it in the classroom.  This allows for concept exploration and supports more evolved discussion, knowledge integration and learning.
09:54:35	 From Peter Kaminski : individual knowledge units, and contentiousness around them, negotiating consensus

# Flotilla Friday, 2021-10-01

## Topics

- _how_ to pick a time for more FFs
- ees dsq321, real quick
- updates about other communities
- debrief last week
- partition the problem of interoperability
- decentralization and web3
- hyperknowledge

## How to Pick More Times for FF

- geographic coverage
    - Pacific
    - Eastern
    - Europe (CET, BST)
    - Thailand
- friendly for people who have jobs
- some options
    - two meetings a week
    - alternating times every week
    - collaboratively chosen times, probably different, each week
- goals
    - have more than one time, because one time will never work for everybody
    - minimize noise and confusion around "what time is the meeting?"
    - minimize split-brain community

### Outcomes this meeting

- stick with current time until Daylight Savings time settles down
- do the actual time picking asynchronously
    - maybe a google sheets thing, or doodle or something

### Minimizing split-brain community

- be good about agendas beforehand
- be good about reporting out afterwards
- be good about recording meetings (automate?)
    - re: recording and processing meetings, Pete, Jerry, Bentley are thinking of making some code/service that helps do that
- make sure at least a few people can attend both meetings and cross-inform / cross-connect the meetings# Flotilla Friday, 2021-10-08

- notes for last week, 2021-10-01: https://github.com/Flotilla-Tools-for-Connectors/Flotilla-Wiki/blob/main/Meetings/Flotilla%20Friday%2C%202021-10-01.md
- hackmd for next week, 2021-10-15: https://hackmd.io/@peterkaminski/Sy5cYxR4t/edit

Sections below:

- What Flotilla Is Thinking About
- Ideas For Topics
- Collaborative Knowledge
- Flotilla Friday, 2021-10-01 video recording and notes
- Zoom Chat
- 2021-10-08 MX notes so far

## What Flotilla Is Thinking About

- we need a Flotilla website
    - Pete, Michael
- we need a static site for the Flotilla Wiki
    - Pete
- we like interoperability! (what does that mean?)
- we want to try syndicating data more
    - Person profile between Trove, Factr, Massive Wiki
- Project Clambake (what's that?)
- we should talk more about what Flotilla is and isn't

## Ideas For Topics

- Hyperknowledge meetings, Tuesdays 10am PT
- Collaborative knowledge / collective knowledge
- Vincent collaborative event curation updates
- Wendy McLean updates on my project of weaving a knowledge network
- Mark - are ads ok?
- suggestion about collaborative knowledge vs meeting notes.
    - agree that we should have some sort of overall notes/current state of the system
- 2 most useful repo items for me: video recording posted, notes with take-away or next steps to help guide our next meeting
-

## Collaborative Knowledge

- meeting notes
- need a current state of the system
- different kinds of artifacts
- cost of getting transcription accurate enough for sensemaking
- Flows vs stocks
- collaborative wiki-ing
    - e.g., 1 shared computer for Obsidian and HackMD, using screen sharing (VNC), and HackMD for additional people who are single-tracking through VNC
- https://demo.idealoom.org

[[Vincent Arena]]

> i saw the chat rant and i enjoyed it :D

Peter Kaminski

> :D

> "colonizers"

[[Mark Carranza]]

> Vernor Vinge

Vincent Arena

> one person doing the work - is that because everyone has their own tool?

> i think the real question is: what will make others use the tools we use?

[[Marc-Antoine Parent]]

> Vincent probably....

[[Wendy McLean, NY]]

> +1 Vincent

Vincent Arena

> I’d like to share some collaborative event curation updates :D

Wendy McLean, NY

> I’d like to share updates on my project of weaving a knowledge network

Mark Carranza

> I have a use of Trove question, - friends are starting a company consulting to non-profit sustainable organizations

> Ar ads for “commercial service”

> Are ads — ok?

Vincent Arena

> Mark - great question…. i have an interesting answer for that

[[BentleyDavis.com]]

> I have a suggestion about collaborative knowledge vs meeting notes.

Vincent Arena

> tuesday 10am PST - what is the meeting??

Wendy McLean, NY

> 2 most useful repo items for me: video recording posted, notes with take-away or next steps to help guide our next meeting

[[Jack Park]]

> @Wendy +1 on knowledge weaving

Peter Kaminski

> can somebody grab the topic suggestions here and put them on hackmd

Vincent Arena

> I agree that we should use the end of the meeting to catalog/record/organize….

Jack Park

> Athens claims they are about to announce a collaborative version - which would give you the power of Roam in an online platform for meetings

Vincent Arena

> added the topics into the notes :D

Peter Kaminski

> thanks vincent!

Jack Park

> Athens and Obsidian are in pretty much the same space, though Athens is OSS. Obsidian is much more refined.

> Flow and curation!! +1 @Wendy

Mark Carranza

> “Duty paralyzes spontaneity”

Marc-Antoine Parent

> athens is only partly OSS, iirc

Wendy McLean, NY

> Yes Pete! I’m saying it’s a dance. Both are important

> Slowing down to sense make and allowing the flow of conversation to happen as needed

Marc-Antoine Parent

> the other option is to have rhythmic breaks to alternate between fast and slow. Of course that also takes discipline.

Mark Carranza

> VNC?

Marc-Antoine Parent

> screen sharing solution

BentleyDavis.com

> VNC: Virtual Network Computer. Allows you to control someone elses pc.

Marc-Antoine Parent

> yes screen sharing and control

Jack Park

> https://tigervnc.org/

Mark Carranza

> Changing human behavior

> — our own

> Is hard but can be fun

[[Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com]]

> A possible experiment: Say we chop up the video of this meeting, roughly per speaker (problematic I know, due to crosstalk and interaction) and tag it. With tags (some of which Mark is generating), even if not that this group of granular segments can be searched —better and better—by a.) speaker, b.) subject(s) c.) time d.) links mentioned, e.) whatever else. Then comments can be made on those individual segments, so discussion can be expanded upon, one-off quotes can be quoted by those for whom they are notable, speakers can elaborate or clarify (or recant!) links can be added, etc.

Vincent Arena

> question: what do we want to see as outputs? what do others want to see?

Peter Kaminski

> i'm currently using TightVNC on the windows server, and either the built-in Mac viewer (for ease of getting started) or the RealVNC viewer.

Wendy McLean, NY

> Do you mind stopping your share? I’d love to see people better.

Peter Kaminski

> np, thank you for asking :-)

Wendy McLean, NY

> +1 Vincent

Mark Carranza

> The way archive.org does TV news:

> https://archive.org/details/BBCNEWS_20181020_213000_The_Papers/start/588/end/648?q=bentley+davis

Peter Kaminski

> Thanks @Michael. In my mind, the thing to do is to pause every 5-10 minutes, and then have one or several people mindmap (maybe visually, or maybe in a wiki) what was just discussed, in a way that everyone can see the map.

Mark Carranza

> … by clip + transcript

Vincent Arena

> bring your kid to flotilla day next week?

Peter Kaminski

> possible output: a glossary

Mark Carranza

> It’s experimental, and we are developing a new context — as shared — and it will take time

Peter Kaminski

> the output i'd want is a group memory and group thinking/conversation space, in a wiki

Mark Carranza

> Any new medium needs time to be assimilated '

Wendy McLean, NY

> +1 Vincent

Vincent Arena

> https://www.catalist.network/group/flotilla?tab=Opportunities

BentleyDavis.com

> Pete, can you create a hack MD for the next meeting so we can prep/agenda for next meeting?

Vincent Arena

> my personal pain points and things id want for an output of a group memory: i want to highlight a piece of a youtube video and save it for later. i want to add quick notes. i want to “do later” on a link someone shared….. i want to be able to bring together multiple peoples notes in different formats so i can see them without asking them a year later. i want to be able to easily find anything related to a past event on any device in less than 5 steps.

# Flotilla Friday, 2021-10-22

## Topics

- Radicle
- Vincent's back from Europe!
- FedWiki Phototelling
- firming up the Flotilla infrastructure and organization
    - knowing what we want to do
    - having better web endpoints
        - hackmd
        - website
        - manifesto
- Closing Some Flotilla Open Loops
- Netlify CMS?
- Project Clambake Maps

## Project Clambake Maps



## Where to collaborate

- one or several HackMD pages? a massive wiki?
- should allow editing from a phone
- Git on phone:
    - Git Journal
    - Working Copy
    - this (Hackmd on phone?) works fine! - vincent

### Resolved

- Massive Wiki for persistent, async collaboration
- HackMD "Flotilla Friday" for realtime collaboration during meetings
- HackMD "Flotilla Dashboard" for easy-to-use/find Flotilla
    - probably not the native HackMD GitHub sync
    - probably an API sync from HackMD to whatever endpoint - Google Docs, Trove, Massive Wiki



## Sync to/from HackMD

Options

- native HackMD GitHub sync
    - complex because of the way HackMD wants to be flexible about which HackMD version gets synced
- HackMD API-based sync, with a microservice we find/write
- Hedgedoc modifications to make GitHub sync more reasonable
- shortest path may be to control sync from tools we control (MassiveWiki, Trove)
- Most abstract idea: sync service
    - Each "source" should be able to provide snapshots and events, and absorb events from other sources (even if only in event form.)

## Some JavaScript Diagramming Libraries

- https://www.npmtrends.com/diagram-js-vs-gojs-vs-jointjs-vs-jsplumb-vs-mxgraph
- https://www.npmtrends.com/d3.js-vs-gojs-vs-jointjs-vs-jsplumb-vs-mxgraph
- https://www.npmtrends.com/flowchart.js-vs-jointjs-vs-mermaid# Flotilla Friday, 2021-10-29

## Topics

- Hyperknowledge
- Zapier zap to grab Meet and Zoom videos to Google Drive, and thence to YouTube

## Next Topics

- shared names etc for data/boundary objects
- up-to-date list of things discussed/to discuss, action items, etc.
- Flotilla website

## Hyperknowledge

Marc-Antoine's seminar this week.



# Flotilla Friday, 2021-11-05

colophon notes:

- recording started a number of minutes after the hour, while timestamps in this doc start at the hour

- Hyperknowledge
- Pete's OGM Thursday 2021-10-28 Hypertext Knowledge Workbook

## ActivityPub and ForgeFed 

### ActivityPub

- used in Solid (and Fediverse?)

### ForgeFed

> ForgeFed (formerly GitPub) is a decentralized federation protocol based on the W3C's ActivityPub, which extends ActivityStream 2.0. It provides a server to server API for pull request, forking and subscription of repositories provided by Git web services (services like GitHub, GitLab, Gogs, Gitea).

- https://github.com/forgefed/forge-fed
- https://notabug.org/peers/forgefed.git
- https://forgefed.peers.community

## Hyperknowledge

- social scope
- local default scope
- translation tables at context boundaries
- massive conversations and massive agreements (00h30m)
- context switches can happen even down to **one sentence**

## Pete's OGM Thursday 2021-10-28 Hypertext Knowledge Workbook

A "hypertext knowledge workbook" distillation (or really, an unfinished one; it's an interesting but unfinished prototype) of last week's OGM Thursday 2021-10-28 call:

- [OGM Thursday 2021-10-28 workbook, website version](https://ogm-thursday-2021-10-28.openglobalmind.com/colophon), (pro tip, use the nav buttons at the top)

- [OGM Thursday 2021-10-28 downloadable zip](https://github.com/OpenGlobalMind/ogm-thursday-2021-10-28/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), download and unzip

If you open the unzipped directory in Obsidian.md, you'll get a better hypertext experience, but you can still get a lot of value just out of the text files, which can be viewed/edited with a text editor or a markdown editor.

[all the stuff about the zip file is for people who don't want to bother with git/github, and maybe not even Obsidian]# Flotilla Friday, 2021-11-12

## DMX

Ward sez,

As arrows is a drawing tool, I would like to inform you that I use a different one:
https://dmx.berlin/
https://search.maven.org/artifact/systems.dmx/dmx-storage-neo4j/5.2.1/bundle
https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-platform/dmx-platform.git

I see DMX has a lot to offer. Skimming the plugin authoring guide I notice a departure from both Neo4j and Graphviz:

https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ZueksMDcZDiJqblmLpjGElAN

()

Aside: I've shown this to Neo4j experts who have not been impressed. I think this is because they live in a world where they improve the representation of data they have. The value in this diagram is that I can see what I have and also how I learned it. In a world where all sources are incomplete and out of sync this is crucial for writing robust queries an interpreting their results.

Wendy uses the phrase "associative connections"

## Imagine what Flotilla could achieve, do better, do more of in 2022

- i loved
- i wish
- i wonder

## I Loved

Flotilla was a place where people who are really trying to get things to work together, come together and talk about it in detail.

Momentum of working together.

I love coming to the calls for the people.

Serious, but not solemn.

Talked about important things.

Good group size; we know each other well, so we don't need intros, and we could build working momentum over the weeks.

Having the group help figure out "burning frustrations".

## I Wish

I wish for a new website. :-)

I wish for two or three things to really weave and operate together.

I wish I had an easy way to look over the Flotilla knowledgebase and meeting notes.

## I Wonder

I wonder if there's some way we can all benefit from each others' successes.

I wonder if we could do a gardening session for 2021's links.

I wonder if we could be open about what we need.

- means we know what we need ourselves! :-)

I wonder if we could use tokens to recognize us sharing each other's ideas when those ideas are really valuable to us.

- getting credit for what we do
    - I wonder if we could do a session on this?
    - how do we want to be recognized, in social/economic ways.
- token discussions
    - Sprig (Pete) - Solana
    - Voz (David Bovill) - Polkadot

I wonder about:

- discovering what others have and what others need
- matchmakers who help others match haves and needs

I wonder if CTA could hire a 1) really good headhunter, and 2) a sociocracy ninja.

I wonder if we dont have a silo problem. OGM works great because of the philosophy "Strong opinions weakly held"

Service Discovery

Who, who, how can i help?

Doing matchmaking on top of the database.

The overhead of doing business with each other is smaller inside the business walls.

I wonder if we can all commit to keeping /now pages.

I wonder if we can all commit to publish our contact/profile details in an agreed-upon format, and then create aggregators for those profiles.

I wonder if we can share "project days" -- we pick one day in February for each project, and barn-raise for that project.
