Catalist is a guild/organization/group that I think wants to eventually have a community and be a broader collection of tools/products, potentially be a cooperative of many tools. 

Trove is a focused product, the first product that has come out of the catalist ecosystem. It’s a directory system for communities that combines elements of knowledge management tools with a social component (the vision is Reddit meets federated wiki for groups and networks)


- Zero Friction Community formation

Progressive accounts
People bring their own profiles
connect peer to peer
transclude/link to their own massive wike and other content
