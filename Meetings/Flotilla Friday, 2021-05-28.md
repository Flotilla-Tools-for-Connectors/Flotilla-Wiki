## AI, BCI, etc.

"Crossing the postmodern divide"
Book by Albert Borgmann
- hyperactive vs. despondent
    - and wise?

wisdom
- at the embodied level (0:30)

augmentation + inequality
- capital
- knowledge

augmented human networks vs. the borg

build stuff not in capitalist, accretive system

wisdom not enough
- grounded in land, local
- links between local
- grounded yet connected
    - without erasure

## Commons and Governance

- Generative Commons
- Dietz, P., Ostrom, E., & Stern, Paul C., "The Struggle to Govern the Commons", Science 12 December 2003:  Vol. 302 no. 5652 pp. 1907-1912, DOI: 10.1126/science.1091015
- Linked Open Wisdom Commons

- epistemological commons
- ontological commons (ways of being)

- propositional knowledge
- modes of existence

- progressive partial formalization
    - alignment without (some) formalization is usually a mess; BUT, never wait for full formalization (it's asymptotic)

what we have discovered, and who has connections to that (0:43)

## Flotilla

- Trove
- Massive Human Intelligence Project
- CICOLAB
- Factr

- directories
- matchmaking
    - individuals
    - projects
    - organizations
- federated groups

09:06:08 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : Deitzl, P., Ostrom, E., & Stern, Paul C., "The Struggle to Govern the Commons", Science 12 December 2003:  Vol. 302 no. 5652 pp. 1907-1912, DOI: 10.1126/science.1091015
09:08:38 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : Benjamin: can you put a link to the writing you were talking about here?
09:09:55 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : Linked Open Wisdom Commons White Paper (work in progress, thinking out loud, super vulnerable to share such an early stage doc, open for feedback):
09:09:57 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : https://roamresearch.com/#/app/CivHubxCivilizationOS/page/3MXAXzEPV
09:10:05 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : when we move from flotilla to armada we will really have a naming issue
09:10:44 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : lol
09:10:45 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : I‚Äôd love to talk about integrating massive wiki and trove on this call
09:11:04 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : Also token curated registries, SourceCred, etc
09:19:41 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : https://hackmd.io/@peterkaminski/BkuPXq0Fu
09:23:16 From vincent arena to Everyone : Charles is alluding to technologies that allow humans to use AI (transhumanism technologies that are in trials right now)
09:23:28 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : BCI 4 GOOD
09:23:33 From Marc-Antoine Parent to Everyone : Yes that's the been the transhumanist claim forever
09:23:44 From vincent arena to Everyone : (having google or trove or massive literally plugged into your brain)
09:24:14 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : I believe our organic capacities are exponentially more powerful when leveraged.
09:24:32 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : These rational materialists ain‚Äôt got nothin on non-dual Gnostic genius
09:24:39 From Marc-Antoine Parent to Everyone : I believe in augmentation, but I don't need it requires neural ink.
09:25:48 From Marc-Antoine Parent to Everyone : But there's a fact that even without the neuralink, there's a polarization in how we use information. some people thrive in the info-rich medium of the net, others become lazy because it's out there.
09:28:44 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : and Pete that is with AI that is not that ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù
09:29:05 From charles blass to Everyone : cicolab monday howard rheingold in thee hot seat on smart mob politics
09:29:09 From Marc-Antoine Parent to Everyone : and breaking things
09:29:19 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : Propositional knowing is just one way of knowing. Semantic web is only propositional.
09:29:31 From charles blass to Everyone : then we discuss the blackpaper, after howard
09:29:36 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : We‚Äôre still in flesh suits on a living earth.
09:29:39 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : Benjamin - bingo!

09:33:23 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : Human networks can beat the borg.
09:34:29 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : Machine learning permaculture ü§îüòÆüòü
09:34:47 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : Cosmo-local networks
09:34:52 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : Grounded yet connected
09:35:04 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : What gets erased in the connection and abstraction?
09:35:22 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : Globalists derive power from erasure.
09:36:00 From Marc-Antoine Parent to Everyone : http://www.open-atlas.org/
09:37:25 From Marc-Antoine Parent to Everyone : https://www.communecter.org/#home
09:37:35 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : I think this conversation could ground a bit in the context of the link between trove and massive wiki
09:37:50 From charles blass to Everyone : +1
09:39:10 From Marc-Antoine Parent to Everyone : It has to be a federation effort!
09:42:57 From Marc-Antoine Parent to Everyone : Benjamin would love to talk about epistemological commons! maparent@acm.org
09:44:10 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : Benjamin and Marc-Antoine: me too.
09:45:39 From charles blass to Everyone : MessyWiki
09:45:40 From Marc-Antoine Parent to Everyone : as in Bruno Latour?
09:45:43 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : the big ‚ÄúO‚Äù Ontology
09:46:28 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : Bruno Latour
09:48:29 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : Finally found a decent link for my integral ontology reference.

09:49:38 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : John Vervaeke's lecture series ‚ÄúAwakening from the Meaning Crisis‚Äù
09:55:38 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : move into information space (what is that?)
09:57:05 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : connective intelligence information spaces
09:58:20 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : Collaboratively generated source of truth contrasted with collaboratively generated clusters of sources of truth
09:59:17 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : the four sides to every story: your side, my side, the truth, and what really happened
10:00:45 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : I‚Äôm seeing the need for another tool that works with massive wiki to work through branching and integration. Thinking about SourceCred on Discourse forums for the dialectic process. Source of truth ie wiki represents the emergent consensus of the branches.
10:01:04 From Marc-Antoine Parent to Everyone : Benjamin we really should talk...
10:02:41 From vincent arena to Everyone : sorry everyone dealing with some issues right now have to run. have fun!
10:07:05 From Benjamin Life to Everyone : Including cognitive bias and emotional trauma response.
10:09:03 From Marc-Antoine Parent to Everyone : between public and private, the translucent/porous boundaries....
10:09:39 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : "translucent" work
