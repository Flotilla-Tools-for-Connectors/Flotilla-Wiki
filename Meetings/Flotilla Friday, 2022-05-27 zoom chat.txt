00:07:43	Jonathan Sand:	attention
00:07:51	Pete Kaminski:	the word we're talking about is attention
00:08:01	Pete Kaminski:	rival goods vs. non-rival goods
00:09:31	Wendy McLean, NY:	value “engagement”
00:09:48	Marc-Antoine Parent:	A much more interesting measure yes
00:11:09	Jonathan Sand:	value “benefit”
00:11:36	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	attention, engagement, focus, time…pretty much the same thing in that are all yours and finite
00:12:46	Pete Kaminski:	value as importance

value as commodity

rival good vs. non-rival good

attention, engagement
00:12:56	Stacey Druss:	I think where I am going is that the community should pay for the service and then provide it to the community.
00:13:51	Pete Kaminski:	community currency, alternative currency, time banks...
00:14:14	Stacey Druss:	Just like how taxes were supposed to be. Led to other issues but let's not throw the baby out with the bath water.
00:14:25	Pete Kaminski:	attention economy
00:14:35	Pete Kaminski:	stepping away, but i can still hear
00:15:45	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Stacey.  The service then in this case could be access to knowledge sets... free to the general public, like a library is paid for by taxes and contributions.
00:16:14	Stacey Druss:	Yes Wendy, exactly.
00:16:52	Pete Kaminski:	money, finance, economy
00:17:25	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	control of your ofn time and attention is not only valuable, it's almost priceless. Getting paid (literally or in “fun”/mind candy) for your attention is a very passive and generally unproductive model. How do we we give value to what's useful/productive, but not entertaining/engaging?
00:19:01	Marc-Antoine Parent:	colonization of the lifeworld by the economic system
00:19:19	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	+1 M-A
00:19:51	Wendy McLean, NY:	measuring value of stuff (commodities) is different from measuring value of human time / attention!
00:19:57	Wendy McLean, NY:	~ Pete
00:20:52	Stacey Druss:	What about an hour for an hour? Then the question becomes whose hour is worth more? Why? That leads to where I'm going regarding payment for information.
00:21:10	Stacey Druss:	And values
00:21:33	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	it’s extractive of productive human potential
00:21:47	Stacey Druss:	+1 Michael
00:22:46	Wendy McLean, NY:	Value of services…. measure in potential for human connection, growth, and healing; well-being (teachers, nurses, therapists, coaches, mentors, etc having the most value)
00:22:56	Marc-Antoine Parent:	right. There is a sensible differential value between skill and unskilled labor... which should be bounded by the ratio of time invested in training vs time worked, not that much! (Plus possibly a risk factor.) OTH... there is an offer and demand curve for rare expertise, which supposedly justifies the cost differential. (And artificial scarcity maintained by professional orders.)
00:23:26	Stacey Druss:	@Pete, is that true that you are not using up attention? Maybe yes, maybe no. Are you getting something in return? Maybe yes, maybe no.
00:23:40	Marc-Antoine Parent:	You could say Amazon has converted a non-rival good into a rival good.
00:24:30	Wendy McLean, NY:	Polls/ questionnaires could include already standard measurements for human flourishing, as a measure of the value of the service.  Did the PERMA score improve?  Is this town a happier place to live?
00:24:42	Marc-Antoine Parent:	+1 Wendy
00:25:01	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Of course, the devil's in the detail; how to agree on measurement methodology?
00:25:21	Marc-Antoine Parent:	(which will be gamed, make no mistake)
00:25:31	Stacey Druss:	+1 Wendy
00:25:43	Marc-Antoine Parent:	(not a reason not to do it, to be clear)
00:26:17	Wendy McLean, NY:	@Marc-Antoine... already many exist.. Could start with a collection of a few different ones.  THEIR value could be discovered in how effective they are in creating a loop of making decisions that improve quality and meaning for the lives those decisions effect.
00:26:30	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Pete: “Economists must learn to substract” (vs GDP)
00:26:47	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Wendy: absolutely. A continuous learning loop is key.
00:26:55	Wendy McLean, NY:	Agree!
00:27:39	Wendy McLean, NY:	Instead of GDP, Gross Domestic Happiness (GDH) - already exists
00:27:58	Stacey Druss:	+1 Wendy and Pete
00:28:58	Marc-Antoine Parent:	There's been a perverse phenomenon in non-profits, though. Having to prove that your program increases measurable indicators can take up all the resources of the organization.
00:29:19	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	on an individual attention-paying level, triple (or more) bottom line applies to the benefit of spending attention, and having attention paid to you.
00:29:30	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Again there  are solutions; just a trap to be aware of
00:29:40	Stacey Druss:	+1 Michael
00:31:17	Wendy McLean, NY:	I think meetings like this are at the pinnacle of human experience and so finding a way to value this within economics, I believe would come last.
00:33:21	Wendy McLean, NY:	Candy brings pleasure, but not long-term happiness because it diminishes health.  Wholistic solutions would rise up in wholistic measurements.
00:34:49	Wendy McLean, NY:	The most addictive content
00:35:08	Marc-Antoine Parent:	short vs long-term value, can be another limitation of naive measurement
00:36:54	Marc-Antoine Parent:	dune :-)
00:37:30	Wendy McLean, NY:	DUNE!
00:37:33	Marc-Antoine Parent:	love as an anti-rival good
00:37:34	Stacey Druss:	Love and attention is not the same thing. Ask a mother who needs to divide her attention.
00:38:03	Marc-Antoine Parent:	meditation is high attention, actually ;-)
00:38:09	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Stacey!!!!!
00:38:43	Stacey Druss:	@Marc-Antoine attention that you receive value from
00:38:50	Wendy McLean, NY:	The type of attention that builds CONNECTION
00:38:51	Marc-Antoine Parent:	ie. its surveillance of you does not qualify as attention to you
00:39:41	Stacey Druss:	Maybe we should measure the quality of attention?
00:39:59	Marc-Antoine Parent:	and that's why I love engagement as a metric: no way surveillance is engagement.
00:45:38	Marc-Antoine Parent:	When you say something has value, you're creating a market. In French law, the intellectual property does not have value, it's inalienable. You can sell the artwork, or exploitation rights, but not the ownership of the creation.
00:46:22	Marc-Antoine Parent:	It is chilling that we're having conversations about the monetary value of privacy.
00:46:47	Pete Kaminski:	human flourishing, human well-being, human thrivability
00:47:38	Pete Kaminski:	gdh gross domestic happiness / gross domestic happiness - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness
00:47:40	Wendy McLean, NY:	“Where attention goes, energy flows”. Where I put my attention should first have value to ME and then also ideally build CONNECTION to an OTHER.  If my attention builds energy / value only for ANOTHER, something is broken.  Choice needs to enter back in and attention/ enegagement needs to go somewhere else.
00:49:06	Stacey Druss:	Wendy is describing the way I look at the American public ;)
00:51:02	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	Media literacy!!!!
00:51:14	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	No need to apologize Stacey :)

The world is more just when actions are moral, rational, equitable, and fair; more verdant, when the planet and its people flourish; and more peaceful, when people are free from fear, conflict, violence, and war.

Our mission leads with justice because we believe that justice is the essential condition for universal human dignity, equitable opportunity, and shared prosperity.

00:57:46	Pete Kaminski:	yeah :-)
