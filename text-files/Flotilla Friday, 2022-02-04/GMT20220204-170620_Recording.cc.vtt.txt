WEBVTT

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Welcome all.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I feel like I've been busy on other stuff this week so I haven't really even set up even less thought about what we talked about this week.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Not that that ever. And the other thing by the way I'm gonna drop off at 10

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
be too so maybe.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Maybe that's the pattern for today.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We can keep it open but yeah I have to go at the same time.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Me too.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I have I've been thinking about something relative to the tapestry that I'd love to talk to people about and get their feedback on if people are interested.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I know you guys are already aware of the x and y, so I'm working on z, like what are those categories which is translates into. What kinds of things do we want to see in the tapestry, so I would love to just run that by everybody and see what they think

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
at some point.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Awesome.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Cool after, when he shares about the tapestry, um, I'd like to give a brief update on the encyclopedia table. I've been working on that in terms of like the design and then also.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm going to be planning a workshop and wanted to maybe pass by with you guys what would be the best way to set up a like ontology. I'm testing experiment, so like, in Kiko lab, Lauren had us do a lot of like card sorting activities where it'd be like,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:02:02.000
all right, like there's a bunch of cards here and there's a bunch of categories and like we're all going to like swarm and like move things around. And so, I was thinking of designing an experiment kind of like that which would test the hypothesis of

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:20.000
like, Are these the right categories. And so it's very open ended, but I want to design something that's not going to like, yeah, it's basically like experiment design, like making sure it's not constraining people, but also not being to open where it's

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
not useful.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You wish I had for ontology says that you is that it would be cool if you could use different people's ontology is as kind of different overlays.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
You know I want to see.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Vincent categories I want to see Pete's categories I want to see when these categories and and then I think so. And the other thing about ontology is it's maybe you're not looking for the best ones you're looking for any that are really bad, and you just

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
want to print those out the ones that don't make sense. Yeah, that makes sense to one person but not anybody else.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But I think the weird thing about categories is you don't really want a category that everybody understands you want a category that many people understand, but maybe some people want right so this would be to basically make sure that this category system,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:30.000
which is very useful for me, and is something that I've been using for a while and develop over a, like a large stretch of time is also useful for at least, other people so that it can be something that multiple people are are using and contributing to

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:44.000
but it is just one set. So, you know, you could also use the tapestry might use the, the, Barbara Marx Hubbard wheel co creation sectors, and someone else might use SD Geez.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:04:03.000
This is another category system which needs to be user tested, but the, the only like other unique thing about this one that I'm working on is that each one of these categories like has to be connected to other categories and other ontology so there's

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:17.000
no category in here that isn't connected to at least one other category in another ontology, and there's no category in another ontology that is not represented here.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Right, so you're trying to create a universal chaotic not a universal just a always interoperable.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Yeah, it's like, because if any, there can be a translation between any of the other ones. Yeah, yeah. Cuz that's slightly different. It depends on how you're going to use it. Right, if it just sits in the background is something interoperable, that's

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
different. And I don't think you mean to just do that. Right. But that would be different than somebody actually trying to use it to categorize something.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So that's something to consider it might be two parts of the workshop. Right.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Or you might want to just focus on the front facing version of it where people are interacting with it, which case I have a suggestion but at some point you wanted to say something.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So there's usability testing, and then there's interoperability testing or usability design and interoperability.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Yeah, yeah. So, right, those are those are the really cool thing about Vincent I you're doing a really good job at both, you've got a very useful ontology and you're also super good at interoperability.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It's hard to do though.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Thanks yes and maybe focusing on one or the other for the workshop and it sounds like you are trying to do the usability side of it. I to people find it useful.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Does it make sense to them.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Because if people aren't categorizing things when they come to add something to Trove in a way that then can be interoperable because what they mean by you know what they were thinking when they put it in this category is not really what it maps to when

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.000
it goes to the other things, then maybe that's, you know, something that, that, and then maybe that's part of what can be worked in, in terms of a test.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
If it were me, I would.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:19.000
A lot of the workshops I do if you present people categories and this isn't for tech This is just priming for people's minds. If you present them with something will try and think of things that fit into the category, in which case you're not really testing

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:34.000
it in my opinion. If you want to come up with, say like kind of like we're doing for the tapestry where I'm saying, you know, hey, what's your Where's your expertise or where is your where your interests, and then see if it fits right then see people

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:46.000
go Oh wait, this doesn't fit anywhere. This doesn't make sense, or if you know it's coming at it from that direction that I think really, really highlights the if people feel like the words means something to them or don't mean something to them.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And that's what I think you're really after is the.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:02.000
If it all fits fine You're not gonna learn anything, right, saying if you. It's when it doesn't fit. Oh, there's a hole or oh this word doesn't mean what I think it means to every to enough people are.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Yeah, so, like, I think one of the experiments, it could be like here. Everyone gets two articles, right like a random set of articles and then it's like okay, if you had to add this into one, which one would it be if you had to add it into multiple which

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:32.000
multiple would it be, and then you can see the map, and you could see no one add anything into here, or here. And what I would probably want to do. I don't know if this is like framing it too much is like, pick an article that I think fits in each one

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:43.000
of the categories, and then see the distribution of like, if it's like a very solid distribution or if like there, they get concentrated in certain categories.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Um, so that's like one experiment design that I was thinking about but it could also be, like, it could Wendy we could do a version of it with the tapestry where it's like, Okay everyone like share one offer, and then see how people categorize them, so

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000
there's different yeah there's different ways of doing it, and that each experiment would kind of give you some slightly different information I would assume.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Yeah, yeah and I bet we could come up with a way to design it that flows pretty quickly, for people, and then we can just repeat it a couple times and you'd get that those different angles on it, without it being too mentally taxing.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Right.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Yeah.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Yeah, it's a good idea, Vincent to test it out that way.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:55.000
We could also preset it, like I've been meaning to do this with your with your with all the different sets that you've already curated and do a little research on which ones already.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:12.000
they hadn't even tested the set yet that they were proposing. Right. And so there's a different level of, you know, to me, we may want to look at this, do a little research do the do the 10 of the 27 that are really solid sets and make sure those 10 are

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:24.000
really interoperable because those are going to be the ones that most other people are going to be interested in using to the ones, ones that are out there for a while ones that people are already familiar with STDs, right, things like that, whereas these

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:39.000
other ones that are up and coming, you know, we can be curious about maybe they have offered up some extra category so we may want to look at it that way to and frame it a little bit for people simply by the way we construct the workshop.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And I'm saying we because I'm more than happy you know I'll help you with us. I'm happy to know.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
right now, obviously, I'm.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:06.000
This is kind of the hard part about the interoperability and Bill your question of like how to add new categories is informations already tagged with a category.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:24.000
If a new categories added there needs to be a process of like, potentially re categorizing information that other people have tagged in the past. And so, I assume the edits would be this category is getting split into two or two are getting merged or

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:32.000
a whole new one is being added in the whole new one being added that's easy because you just add a new one and then people can start adding information to it.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:44.000
The other two would require like making a workflow that would look at all the past data that's tagged with that thing and then like figuring out how to parse it.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And, and my guess is by creating this you're trying to avoid that too much of that in the future.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Can I share a couple of words.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Okay, so my experience with tapestry.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Although you made it really, really easy. I found that a little bit of a challenge, which I really enjoyed, because it made me reflect again on things, my own experience and stuff like that and how it might be communicated or written out.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So I really enjoyed that.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And I found it valuable.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
So I think when you say I wanted to just be easy for people to do blah blah blah.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
It's like if it's really really easy, then like you said when they will really not doing anything now.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Because you don't want it to be that easy.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
We want to be challenged.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It'd be that for me that's what I want.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Because then we may actually come up with something new.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Rather than going, oh yeah that's just like I don't want cooking thing, you know, even though I wasn't thinking of cooking.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And the other thing I wanted to say, Vincent The, the thing that struck me both your a tapestry is like.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And the other thing I wanted to say, Vincent The, the thing that struck me both your a tapestry is like MP what you said about ontology I mean, these kinds of things are like, it's like a, it's a thing where it's like it's like a kind of a technology

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:26.000
that we used to, because it helps solve a problem or set of problems I mean I'm just starting to read about science from, you know, indigenous perspectives, but I gotta tell you, this is not like the chemistry history chemistry I learned when I was a

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
graduate student.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So there. I mean, and I think we just have to be clear that there was not going to be one ontology.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:54.000
These things are grounded in a context that actually supports a certain aim goal, culture, whatever, you know, or just, you know, today's meeting is going to be like, you know, crazy dark, whatever.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
So I think it's really, you know, expecting interoperability everywhere is.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I don't know about that because you're just going to run into things where we're just not going to talk about that. My job is American anthropologist, so I see the setting sun, you know I'm thinking physics.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Oh, she's not. It's the same sunset.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:32.000
We're holding hands is great. But, you know, it's at some at some intellectual kind of level it's not not exactly the same thing.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:44.000
So instead of universality you really want interoperability, you want to be able to answer the question of is how, how do you know what when you have it interoperability or yeah this is the thing that always come up with computer systems I've had guys

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:53.000
tell me it's going to be interoperable, you know, and I'm the quality control guy, great, you know, how are you going to measure that you got a thermometer for that thing.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I mean I'm a canvas right.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
If you don't have have monitor. What are you talking about, it's interoperable.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
How did you know I mean that's the question.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I think when you go to claim the turnaround for both you have to, you know, because of the following.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:19.000
You know demonstrable evidence facts, something, some kind of measure.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Yeah, so I think kind of the way that works if to take your, your sunset

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:39.000
experience and kind of tease into it a little bit. I think you want to be able to for the participants in the interoperation you want.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000
You want to look at the same thing, and then you know look at it one way and look at it another way, and then have those two people talk to each other.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Okay, you're seeing, you know wavelengths of light blah blah blah. I'm seeing you know multiple experience or whatever.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And there there are people who like maybe aren't fluent in the language but can at least kind of kind of follow along. So, you know, if somebody says okay well what I see when I'm looking at sunset and it's they start going through the atmospheric phenomena

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and stuff like that, a person who's not necessarily versed in science but can at least kind of follow along. So, I think, I think we're looking at the same thing I think you're talking about the same things that I see and, you know, and maybe some of

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:31.000
the like the sunset is different from the last sense that because you captured some of that in your explanation of it, and vice versa, right.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:50.000
So, if you can do the translation between two to ontology, or to whatever's, and then have bridge people, people who are a little bit at least a little bit bilingual like actually kind of like translation right, you know, I can't read Spanish but I can

00:15:50.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I can kind of glance through something and get the gist of something in Spanish or French or whatever. And I can, I could kind of pick up you know, you totally missed the reference to the line that we saw right and just not in the text here.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Or I could look over and go Yeah, it looks like I can't tell exactly that it's, you know, exactly accurate for the English one but I think it captures everything.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:24.000
So, that cross checking and Trent doing the translation and cross checking is somewhere in. How does that work. that's kind of a thermometer.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Yeah, no, I agree. I think when people have to agree I mean this is.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Well this is a little far fetched but you know the reason we have proofs and mathematical proof and mathematic, you know, it's not just, it happens because you're actually other people agree it's a proof.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Yeah.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:52.000
It's not like it's a human thing, we actually yeah I'll go with you With you know I like you know whatever, but we both believe the equal sign is like a cruel, Master.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Well, with words it is because whereas they're just complicated airflow but

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000
So, I want to answer those question after that. Okay, I'm talking the same thing for me.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:29.000
So we're staying on topic the. To me this is so interesting because to me, it's a shift in mindset, a bit from this feeling like everything has to be a one to one relationship like this leads to that and and that that's what I hear too when we're talking

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:43.000
about interoperability perfect interoperability means this thing maps to this, this thing that's to this and. And it's the same old ways and life isn't like that and that's not the way we think about things and your example of a sunset is a perfect example.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:18:00.000
To Me too. And what I love about thinking about the tapestry more and the reason why I keep getting excited about it is because I think it allows us to say see the sunset sunset becomes a resource and one person puts it in one place and another person

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:16.000
puts in another place. So one way we could look at that is, is completely missed the fact that this this resources into places because right now. The sunset is mapped to physics here and it's mapped to paintings here right our beautiful artistry here.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:33.000
However, if we if if we, if I can get the tapestry to work the way I'm hoping it will in my head, then you can also look at each individual resource right and see the multiple places in which it's mapped right so now it's not about trying to get it in

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:51.000
the right place there's no one right place for this resource. So, we can put it, it's okay to have it be in 16 different places and then how interesting, is it when we take a look at it and say, Wow, this resources being that is has value and all these

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:58.000
different ways. And then as individuals we can look at that and say, well, I've always thought about it as a physics thing.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:10.000
And I'd love to have more conversation with people who think of it like a physics thing. Or conversely, I always think about it as a physics things and I would love to understand it better from the perspective of people who see it from an as artistry.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:26.000
And so to me that's that's the juicy stuff and we not there because generally we categorize in a one to one relationship. So from my perspective, I'm hoping to provide categorization that allows people to just place it where it makes sense to them, but

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:34.000
it isn't asking, it, it, most definitely is not asking them to pick the right place.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Yeah, well I think that's perfect. I will say the one thing that your little tapestry that interesting tech Muslims, one of the more interesting things for me was, you have those set of definitions so that you know that you got, and I read the thing on

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
science seven times and I'm like, I don't know about that one.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
I really do not know about that one at all.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
As it done like.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
But I, but I have an idea what the word means to me.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:18.000
But I have this definition, it's really very peculiar I found. Yeah it is. And it actually comes right for I didn't make it up it comes from our I went to I looked it up and I'm like yeah yeah and it's an infrastructure through me too because when I started

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:31.000
I started thinking about technology I'm like what is technology in like I ended up putting some of my stuff in into infrastructure, right it's so in that case, it's almost like too big and umbrella right I kind of want to, but maybe that's the, maybe

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:40.000
that's the joy of it right maybe that's that's pretty Oh, no I think you're right i think the idea the idea but you're thinking, here's the one thing for me.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
You're like pushing back you know we just can't have your people need to open up to the fact that there's not one to one.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:54.000
I mean, you must be talking to different people and I'm talking to him because I'm living in a world with nothing is wanting to one pretty much as far as I can determine.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Now I know I'm an outlier from the general.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:14.000
A lot of general thinking, because, you know, I just, I don't, I can't. But it seems like the more natural thing is not to expect it is not to expect lineup, when you were talking about translation, this is always confused me.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I mean I learned French in high school. So this is a phrase in French, like when you get something done you want to bring it out you know and you go, voila.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
There it is.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Is somebody who the date of Spanish speakers so what's the term for that in Spanish to like,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
We don't have a one word term for that.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
We don't have a one word for that in English.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:46.000
It's like, so there are things like you know and it's, it's so interesting to me.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:22:04.000
And I think we might expect this in this kind of, you know, even what we build in tapestry or in Trove is going to be idioms that are available in one area community, kind of activity that may not be directly available in another.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
at least not as concisely,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
which would be like, cool.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And the latest thing I've learned was Pete brought this up the other day about talking about things as pushing back against your materialist look at everything as a resource, this is kind of our materialist Neo liberal capitalist while since I've been

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000
reading some other perspectives, I was just thinking about, you know, the tree outside my window here.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:55.000
It's actually a companion, maybe I should think about it as my companion, living in this house rather than, you know, just this tree, which is a you know a different way of looking at things and as resources.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Anyway, I think it's tremendous and I've had a lot of Vincent I feel like I have to go figure out what what it would feel like to actually stick, Bill Anderson, more into Trove.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000
It seems daunting to me.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Well see.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:29.000
That's the balance between yeah it being easier it's challenging, but I don't. I was trying to like sketch out what I think we're getting at here.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
And kind of how I see it is like.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000
You can have a a tag.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Let's just say this is a tag.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:24:01.000
So let's say circle is an object, and this square is like a tag, right so you can have a circle is tagged like a book is tagged with sustainability. And so, the first level, this top part is like inferred relationship.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:21.000
So right, you're not actually letting people decide what this relationship is you're saying if you're tagging this with sustainability, it means it's about, or it's related to.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:44.000
you're saying okay this book. And then you get to actually define and say this book, right, I'm critiques sustainability, so now there's a relationship type, which is not fixed, whereas here, this is simplifying it because all you have to do is tag this

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
whereas this you have to put in the relationship type.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:57.000
And then the other way to do it, which is the most unstructured is actually, Everything is just an object.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000
And then you define that this is a book.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
And this one is a tag.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:20.000
And then you get to choose what the connection type is too.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:31.000
So in the tapestry you're saying like you're creating a response. And then these relationship types there's only there's three sets you can say this is a need.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:49.000
This is an offer or this is suggestion. Right, so you can kind of, there's three options for the relationship type whereas like, um, intro, when you're tagging a book with, like, the high level network like one of these, the relationship is fixed.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
And so it's kind of like you're constraining a variable, you're saying like we're not going to.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Everything is, how is related to, or about right so you're constraining that variable. And so, what I think this is trying to do is actually not interoperability.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
It's to make it easier to translate.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:23.000
And it's only when the context is fixed. So if there's a project database, and these projects are related to this topic.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Then you can translate that topic database into this system, if it's using the SD G's but the relationship type is the same.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Yeah, this is exactly where I've been thinking Vincent and I actually realized that taking doing it by needs and offers and suggestions was actually not helping.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:27:07.000
So what ended up what I've been thinking about is, is as we put in a piece, an interest, an area of expertise, a resource. What I started thinking about is the relationship of the person to the thing that they were putting in and taking out

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:23.000
needs and taking out there basically all offers it all becomes offers right I'm trying to take out those extra layers and just be like, here's what I am bringing forward, this is what I have to offer to this community and however anybody wants to phrase

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:34.000
it that way it could be I have a job offer a job, you know what I mean like, right, but putting it as as framing it as these things I offer so I'm going to show it let me share my screen.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:42.000
And I am on the wrong tabs. One sec.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Because I'm, I think. This gets out the questions too.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
So I literally was just like writing it out I crossed out. We were like relationships.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Right. And here's, so I had gone, here's interest, right, we've got that interest expertise artifacts, which is a word that Vince and I came up with, or actually, he uses in Trove, but I kind of like resources better I keep, I keep stumbling over artifacts.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
And then I realized there's others. There's a story we keep talking about stories.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.000
And then I felt too there's questions that should be in each in each cell or each segment as well.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:42.000
And then we also talked about like sources of funding or things like that so, um, or other sources of like other types of capital, we had talked about too so I'm still playing around with all this but as I started talking about okay well what would be

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:56.000
the relationship with interest right and I realized what I'm really talking about is what is my relationship with my interest in this particular topic, right so I started writing it out as a question I wrote it out as a sentence because I know Vincent's

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:14.000
also going in that direction like every answer within a cell could be written out as a sentence, so I'm trying to think of it that way and the way I'm freezing the drop down for people to select, so let's say you have an interest in gardening.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:28.000
And you're willing to throw that out, and then being able to say, my interest in gardening is like a mild curiosity, right or it's an occasional hobby, just spelled wrong, or it's a true excitement for me or so lifelong pursuit for me so I'm trying to

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:43.000
come up with about four for each, and figure out that relationship and I'm finding that this it has a lot of richness to it and helps people if they wanted to me this would be like a tiered a tiered discernment right they could just put in the interest

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:53.000
you don't have to necessarily put a relationship, although from a data perspective we would really like that, because it's going to enable a lot of other things, but I'm.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:06.000
To me this not everyone's going to want to go to that level, but if we can encourage them to then this would be like the next thing to kind of highlight for people like what kind of interest, do you have what level of expertise, do you have, what type

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:32.000
of artifact is it right. What's your relationship to. So, this is where I'm playing, if anybody has feedback i'd love it.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:40.000
if you see in chat my class. This is a shared doc.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
When you're muted

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
hadn't seen that. Thank you. I will share it.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
You don't mind Vincent right.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
No more the merrier.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Oh, not even so much that I wanted to start typing but it's just, you can see it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no problem comes all seeing what I'm doing anyway.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:15.000
There comes all seeing what I'm doing anyway. The doctors basically.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Yeah, we're playing on the back to like data structure for a response within the tapestry.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Yeah, so what I was showing you were talking about the layers.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Yeah, I'll put it over.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
So it's a little because it's gotten big anyway.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Just going to move it over so that people can find out a lot more easily.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Go.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Um, you know when one thing that that came up for me, and I'm sorry I feel a little bad piping up just because something might.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
But when you were talking about artifacts and resources.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:24.000
The distinction. I don't know if we want to draw it to me is like, you know there's there's a

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:38.000
remnant quality to artifacts that, you know, the, the archival vibe of that which i mean i think is a really great thing and it's definitely

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:46.000
more, maybe a bit more of an emphasis in my work than.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Then, In other you know players in this.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:06.000
This space, whereas resources to me is really alive, and, and, you know, like, where do we go, I mean not not that things can't be both artifacts and resources.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:17.000
I just wanted to throw that up just to see if it you know stimulator the idea of defining them as different things for using them.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
One as a tag on the other.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:32.000
You know, I'm not, I'm not sure where that leads but, but I do get from resources, and on tro, like, you know, we're engaged in activity.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:48.000
These people organizations, you know, funding sources that this is, this is a link to something that's alive and changing as opposed to the artifact being something that's

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:56.000
not not necessarily frozen in the past but, you know, a reference point

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:06.000
a kernel of information that you want to be able to go back to organize and make sure people can find

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:26.000
on that out there. Hopefully not not making more of a mess. Now, that's, yeah thank you because what I hear you saying is that an artifact feels more like something that will stand the test of time and resource has more of a feeling of something alive

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
and active and current.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Yeah, and I mean you know that alive, active and current thing you could refer to as an artifact, you know like, the you know the minutes of the meeting.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:35:03.000
So, you know that that artifact is more stands the test of time that's not going to be probably changing a whole lot. Now, whereas a resource could be so much more and so much more.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:10.000
You know, vibrant, and, and, as you say, changing. Yeah.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Yeah, I mean to me too when I think about going into a library, there's a resource room. Do you know what I mean like, to me it's a word that that is more common in our language but then again, right, it's, it's, it's more common in our language to refer

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:36.000
to, to refer to a collection of things that could be of use to you, versus a versus a museum artifact.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:54.000
So, right, though I mean that's why Thanksgiving I mean the library thing is, to me, a library is is a collection of artifacts, you know the books, the words on the pages of the books aren't going to change.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:15.000
But the library itself is a resource and the interactions you have with, you know, in an existing brick and mortar library the resources that you have in different, you know, collections of artifacts are people who know those artifacts in a specific way

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:27.000
whose expertise you want to tap or, you know, kind of multimedia assets that change.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
You know, those are.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Yeah.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Yeah, I mean, those making you're making the argument to me to lean towards the term resource especially for something like the tapestry where it's we're trying to offer up things that are going to be

00:36:44.000 --> 00:37:04.000
actively used, you know by the by the community. Yeah, I mean I would think, in, in what you're doing resources seems like a more writing room I mean it seems to me like resources on Trove seem right.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:20.000
And only seem a little odd to me when they're something static and archival and, you know, not that those things aren't resources but they're,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:27.000
you know when they're just like an object

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000
unchanging object, it seems a little like a mismatch of terms.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:42.000
And like I guess what I'm saying is you know maybe artifacts are a subset of resources that conjure up a different notion of what you'll get.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Then resource as a whole, which seems more like, here's where I'm going to find, you know, fungible help.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Yeah, that last part that you said that's how I was thinking about it was like capital is a resource. Right.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:22.000
something that hadn't been completed that in like the later stages of like it's out in the world it's like something that you can use. Um, yeah.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:38.000
And so I think the reason why I had suggested artifact was because it's a more specific term than resource and resource could technically be applied towards a lot of these other categories like I think.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:53.000
I think it'd be helpful to say like what are the examples of what would be within this category to actually define it right so the context, like what, like, Yeah, I was thinking, like, in this category would be like project, Wendy would this be like projects

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:01.000
and groups or would it be like projects, and like, tools and stuff that people can use.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000
That's a great question. What would people like to see in the tapestry.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:14.000
If you were, you can think of it two ways right so forget my list for a second. I'm going to stop sharing,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:26.000
forget my list for a second and just go, I think, I think we all kind of kind of agree I'd want to share my expertise, I want to share my interest I think that makes sense to a lot of people but what else, what else would you like to tell about yourself

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000
to a group.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:35.000
What else would you like to share that might be a value to other people.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:44.000
And then we can figure out later how to put it into categories but like what is it, what's the kinds of things that you would want to share with other people.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:52.000
And I'll just take, I'm gonna take notes on the side if people want to just throw stuff out.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
If I could, I don't mean to. Oh, sorry.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Yeah, run the direction of the conversation, but I'm watching 11 kind of going.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Hmm.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
I have a different problem.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
personalize it, I've talked to each one of you.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Once on the phone, maybe one or two of you twice I don't think so, though. And I'm kind of going. Uh huh.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
At wants to help.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Wendy with sigma.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Stacey has made an offer to you know talk and and kind of explore ideas.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Pete and I could talk for three more years and, but not, you know, and the conversation, and still be enthralled till same way Vincent probably and Michael the same way.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:41:03.000
And I'm trying to figure out. All right, where do I spend my time, because this is not in terms of finding people it's like okay I found people.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:23.000
What do I do next. I, you know, I think the work that Ben said, and Wendy you're doing and it, it thrills me I'm really interested in it and I can see you know the value of, of, you know, the introductions.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:36.000
But what do we do after the introductions, that's sort of where I'm at, you know, I found interesting people. How do I collaborate with them, how do I go to the next step.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:56.000
And, and, you know, I sorry I'm gonna have to leave in about seven minutes, maybe even about seven minutes but I just wanted to, as a sort of infrequent member of this group, bring this up because it's kind of been a silent.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Question.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Um, and, you know, I'm looking for help to articulate that and to kind of say, Aha, you know, each one of you is an incredible valuable person, I'd love to spend more time with.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
How do I do that.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:25.000
And, you know, certainly. Listening is contributing, in a way, and I'm happy to listen here. I don't want to derail, you know, the focus that you have.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:46.000
But, but thank you for listening to that. And I don't, I don't need an answer in the, in the present time but I want you to know personally boy I'm really looking forward to our next one on one, and and you know it's it's it's not you, it's me who can't

00:42:46.000 --> 00:43:14.000
figure out how to say, How do I have this plan or, you know, go deeper on some interests, and it's not actually looking at trolls troll, or tapestry that I think I'm gonna find more about Vincent, or Wendy, or or bill.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
And

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
her.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:32.000
I love having questions that I don't have answers for I'm so sorry. I don't have a design framework for okay what's going to connect.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Um, Michael and I together in a way that we're actually going to spend time together. That's productive for us both.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Um, and I think you know the introductions are great and you know there's a world out there besides us. I'd love for them to get together and and do these things, but I asked myself, you know, do I need a artifact in some way, it says Hey Mark you haven't

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
got Stacy and three weeks, got Stacey.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Um,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
anyway.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000
I'll be here for.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:20.000
If you'll forgive I forgive my interruption into I love your interruption thank you because you also had your hand up so I'm glad you just jumped in.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:36.000
As I started running away with with my own train of thought. No, I think I wrote down your questions I think that's exactly the kind of thing that's extremely helpful to think about, because what I do care about most is how, In the end, this being a tool

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:51.000
for connection and collaboration it's, you know, if it's not, if it's not facilitating that next step for people, then, then, I'm not on the right track, and I want to scrap it and I want to change it and I want to do something else with it because that

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:59.000
to me It can't just be a static another piece of information that people have to figure out and absorbing like no one needs any more of that we have enough of that.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Right. And so that's what I hear, inherent in your questions is how does it help us make more connections or facilitate a collaboration or move the conversation forward or right How does it do that and if it's not doing that, let's look at that again.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:27.000
In my mind I'm seeing mark to use your example and see if this resonates with other people. Right now we come to these meetings and we learn a little bit about each other.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:36.000
What if you found out that surprise surprise you and Bill shared interest in 10 different spaces, and you've only ever been talking about one of them.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:50.000
That would make a priority might prioritize for you. Oh, the next person I really need to talk to is Bill, there's so much there that we share that could be a potential, right, it could be that there's some question that's really burgeoning for you in

00:45:50.000 --> 00:46:03.000
a particular area you all of a sudden became super curious about NF T's and how they work and you know you have your own little nugget of information about it but you really want to understand more well it turns out that in your communities there's 25

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:20.000
people you didn't even know who are all interested in working in that space. Anyway, I'm just throwing out potential ideas for how it could help facilitate quicker connection, then the actual connection needs to come from the people right isn't it can't,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:31.000
right, you're still going to do what you would have done before is reach out to people, but now you may reach out and go hey, are the 10 people and say hey is anybody interested in having this conversation and it can be, you know, conversation of 10 people

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:47.000
instead of the time it takes to meet each one of those people individually discover that each one of them is interested in that thing, then get a rap background and go hey maybe we could have a meeting might take months instead of weeks.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:57.000
I, I understand that I think that, you know, this is a incredible stuff for initial connections.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:08.000
I'm.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:16.000
read about Bateson and epistemology and cybernetics, and that there are.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Besides, any other interest in birding anything around them, you know citro in the 50s cars, what have you, that the cybernetics history, and how do you apply cybernetics in the,

00:47:39.000 --> 00:48:00.000
in a unobtrusive way of designing systems for people that work. I think we can go there. They'll tell me if I'm right or wrong, and spend a heck of a lot of time there without, you know, having to know about the 50s cars or the, you know, eco sustainability

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:07.000
side of that. And I'm just trying to figure out. Hmm, I have personally.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000
One more minute.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:11.000
And how do I express this this need.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:22.000
How do I express this this need. Um, so that somehow gets heard, but you know I don't find it.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:37.000
And, you know, Trove or tapestry. Um, it's how do I go to the next level. And you know fig my boy I have that. Wendy on, you know, I'll write it, you know, and on the whiteboard.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:52.000
And it's like, yeah, I really want to pick up segment and I know Wendy wants to work with big mouth, and I haven't done anything before I don't know how many months that we've, we've talked about it and

00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:02.000
one is French practice. And the chat. I'm sorry to have to go I would love to stay longer. Thank you for listening.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Please go back to your regular scheduled stuff, but just thanks for listening because I'm, I'm trying to figure this out. And, and I hope you know all of you that if I had.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
If I didn't have a job.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:26.000
I would be talking to. If you let me an hour each today.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Bye bye.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Park.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
I totally agree.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Great point. You know, it's something definitely that.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:53.000
That is what I'm trying to do you know for sure. That's the motivator for me.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Does it feel what do you guys like it's different steps, or, like, how I thought about it is like okay we need a directory of projects so that people could just find it, like, Oh, this is a project but then like, then you find a directory of products

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:22.000
and there's no contact email, you're like, well, Craig, now I don't do anything so it's like okay yeah you need to have the directory and then you also need to have the way to contact someone, but then, then the next what Mark is saying is like one step

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:48.000
further, in my opinion of like, okay, you actually have someone's contact you know the project but now it's like, what out of the realm of everything.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Yes.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Well, the thing that came up for me when you're saying is like okay I find a project, you know, but I can't find the Ghostbusters phone number so we're done here.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:15.000
But then it says at the bottom who you got to call, got a number. Terrific. Now, I'm interested. There's the project. Here's what I have to call now it's like you're going to do that bill.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Are you just going to pick up a book, I mean, or look at this.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.000
I have a tendency, my wife may say you know I had the squirrel syndrome.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Oh, that's interesting over there. So, so there isn't. You know there's a kind of like, you know, leading horses to water and then like from the Zen things, you know, the Zen teacher thing you know selling water by the riverside, but ever.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:55.000
I think then what I don't know I think I've said this before but I've been reading a lot of history, this is a this is a challenge for the 21st century.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:10.000
For Humanity is how to make these kinds of connections in a way that things happened in like the 1820s and 30s for the world. I mean literally the 1920s was just like a wrap up.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Or, like we're just going to take you know capitalism, to the, to the extreme but now we're in another situation where it's like, well, that's not working as expected.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:31.000
So I think we're in kind of growing pains, this is exactly what

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
you know.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:41.000
I think you're all doing fantastic. I just don't have as much energies I had when I was 35.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:51.000
I mean, literally, so

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000
the clock looks

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
great.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Thank you.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Before, before we sign off tonight. That one thing.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000
This.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:18.000
And I put one thing, chat but, and what Mark saying and what what we've been talking about a lot.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:25.000
I do feel like there is a place for.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:33.000
And this is what interests me and like I want to have and want to do.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:42.000
And, you know, find a way to interlock with with,

00:53:42.000 --> 00:54:06.000
you know, the Internet Archive on the one end and the, you know, I would put trophy Trove edits, and its desire to foment action at kind of the other end of life, you know, Trove is a resource of resources.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:20.000
The Internet Archive is is a resource of artifacts, you know, I mean you don't go to the Internet Archive to like, see what's happening, you go to see what happened.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:27.000
And, you know, and in the,

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:39.000
in the space between, and, and the desire to take the stuff in the archive and a add to it and be curated.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:47.000
There is really really fertile ground for connection that then leads to action.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Even though you're, you're dealing with inactive stuff. I mean, that seems like the space in which you discover. Oh, you know, I'm into this kind of activity and that kind of activity and this kind of activity and when I look at this object.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
I see the.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.000
The tagging and the and who did the tagging and you know you get.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:29.000
You can kind of work at this, this amorphous space from both ends, you know, Trove and, and, and tapestry and massive with the you know and and things you know spin off

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:53.000
and cat about, you know, kind of spin off these, like, static artifacts, which can be grouped in all different ways. And, like, that's the stuff that you know I almost feel like it, you know I was gonna say, I want to put blinders on, but it's decidedly

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:00.000
not blind it's decidedly open to things that go on external to it.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:16.000
But, you know, I don't, you know, want to want to find a way to work in that area, and not the either duplicating, what the Internet Archive is doing.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000
God help us.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:27.000
And, and not be trying to do what you know you guys are doing.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:38.000
It's just like object curation as soil for the growth that's happening elsewhere.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:45.000
I don't know if that's too big, but you know that that

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000
that's that's what I want to contribute.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:54.000
So, yeah,

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
it should be too.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:03.000
It's Michael.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Yep.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Cool.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Yeah, Michael would love to continue the thread. Mm hmm.
