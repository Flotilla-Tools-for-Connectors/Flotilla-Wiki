00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.850
-- This is a flotilla Friday for 2021 September 10.

1
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.860
-- Yeah.

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.510
-- I don't really like having the recordings.

3
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.050
-- But I mean I like having the recordings I guess.

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.050
-- But I don't like recording and feeling like there's somebody kind of having,

5
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.200
-- you know these future watchers hovering over our shoulders.

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.360
-- But on the other hand, um

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.260
-- uh Wendy Elford is a big fan of of uh

8
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.640
-- Having the source material.

9
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.730
-- Well she does her that's a big part of her job as uh you know, text analysis.

10
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.290
-- And she's like, well I can't have text if I don't have transcripts,

11
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.830
-- I can't and she when she talks about transcript,

12
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.350
-- she actually means human corrected 100% correct transcripts.

13
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.060
-- And I can't have transcripts of I don't have recordings and so,

14
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.690
-- you know,

15
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.500
-- well here's my wife's an anthropologist and ethnographer instructions.

16
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.860
So

17
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.460
-- and then in the Bc days when we used to go at the restaurants for eating

18
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.890
-- occasionally,

19
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.420
-- she would get distracted because her anthropologists think

20
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.850
-- like should be listening to the table.

21
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.950
-- Yeah, because

22
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.900
-- that's what we

23
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.350
do

24
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.900
-- reminds me of when my wife and I lived in southern California and

25
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.630
-- sometimes we'd end up in in Hollywood or right around Hollywood having,

26
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.160
-- you know

27
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.010
-- dinner out at a piece of place or something like that.

28
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.530
-- And all the tables around you were talking about scripts and script

29
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.280
-- of workshops and you know deals and all that kind of stuff.

30
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.960
-- It was weird.

31
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.150
-- Yeah. Yeah.

32
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.730
-- We're being in Silicon Valley and all the tables around

33
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.660
-- you are talking about which round they're trying to raise and

34
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.050
-- you know whether the good news is

35
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.350
-- except for the small little

36
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.350
-- python glen where they're still talking about scripts, but there,

37
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.760
-- yeah,

38
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.660
-- yeah,

39
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.370
-- sorry, I'm just moving on.

40
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.460
-- I had a very good week because I actually got some code to running.

41
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.460
-- I kind of learned a lot and I actually

42
00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.560
like

43
00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.290
-- the way the code looks.

44
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.860
So

45
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.710
-- yeah,

46
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.760
-- bills coming off a little bit of a high actually being successful in running cook.

47
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.850
-- Yeah,

48
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.450
-- Which is the big deal. Um,

49
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.400
-- I wonder uh, when you're Michael,

50
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.760
-- if you folks want to talk a little bit about the clambake project

51
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.350
-- and now it's gone,

52
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.360
-- please,

53
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.250
-- I can take a stab at it.

54
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.550
Um

55
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.960
-- yes, so since Michael Vincent and I were able to get together last week,

56
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.760
-- we
-- were

57
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.610
-- basically brainstorm besides aligning our visions

58
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.760
-- and direction and things like that,

59
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.820
-- we were brainstorming.

60
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.410
-- So how can we bring our visions together? And so that's clam big. How do we bring it?

61
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.910
-- How do we bring our visions together?

62
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.950
-- So trove Right now, this is going to be my summary is kind of a warehouse of

63
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.090
-- organizations, projects people right.

64
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.830
-- And in an attempt to help connect all of those things

65
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.560
-- and reduce friction for people to find what they need and

66
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.760
-- projects to find the people

67
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.360
-- factor is a

68
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.460
-- um storehouse, you might say, of

69
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.190
-- links and topics, websites, everything you can find on the web organized,

70
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.480
-- how you want it to be organized.

71
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.470
-- So it's easy to find it again later with the ability to talk about it,

72
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.460
-- discuss it and all that kind of good stuff.

73
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.850
Um

74
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.120
-- and then my contribution is a vision of how we can visualize things better

75
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.980
-- so that we can navigate to those pieces of information we're looking for faster,

76
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.780
-- easier and again reducing friction.

77
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.460
-- So I tend to be all about reducing friction to getting to what we need.

78
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.920
-- My view is also a little more on the personal side,

79
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.430
-- like the individual seeing a need to

80
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.660
improve

81
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.950
-- our individual

82
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.950
-- use of technology so that we can

83
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.350
-- enable individual

84
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.750
um

85
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.460
-- evolution, I guess evolution towards better thinking, more creativity,

86
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.360
-- more innovation so that we can then contribute collaborate like that.

87
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.720
-- The individual comes first in my mind and then

88
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.330
-- it's then you come to the point of collaboration with

89
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.010
-- others and then hopefully we come to the point of

90
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.170
-- collaboration to the point of providing something for society.

91
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.360
-- So I'm just coming at it from the individual side,

92
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.700
-- so creating a UX UI experience that enables individuals to get to what they need,

93
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.840
-- solutions they need,

94
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.570
-- and then similarly scaling up to the same thing for organizations,

95
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.910
-- same things for groups, same things.

96
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.560
-- Okay, so how do we bring all this stuff together? That's

97
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.850
-- that's clam cake,

98
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.520
-- Sorry, and that's so we're fumbling our way so far,

99
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.160
-- it's just a conversation but any input is totally welcome, I hope I did that justice,

100
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.360
-- You did great

101
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.350
-- um house, I wonder about some relationships,

102
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.650
-- how is that related to maps and

103
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.050
-- mapping and collective intelligence and collective knowledge.

104
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.010
-- So for me those are two different questions from me,

105
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.820
-- maps and mapping is the part of my thinking

106
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.740
-- that says how can we use technology to visualize?

107
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.780
-- Are thinking not necessarily data,

108
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.970
-- how can we use technology to help us say I'm thinking

109
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.840
-- this and that leads to 10 more things and that's interesting.

110
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.520
-- That's interesting.

111
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.250
-- Instead of sending me down a rabbit hole pre designed by someone else.

112
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.690
-- Yes, visual thinking thank you Bill.

113
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.770
-- Um instead of sending me down a rabbit hole designed by

114
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.310
-- somebody else to keep me engaged and sell me something.

115
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.060
-- What's the direction that I want to go in? So it's you know it's the brain it's um

116
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.020
-- as we think it's I think some of the stuff is really wisdomtree I've been playing

117
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.330
-- around with um I think a lot of um napkin is trying to do that,

118
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.620
-- I think there's a factor is basically trying to do that in its own way.

119
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.550
Um

120
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.140
-- but following,

121
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.300
-- enabling better thinking for the individual again as being my focus.

122
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.160
-- So for me I have a

123
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.710
-- wisdomtree came the closest so far to the to the visual version of what I want.

124
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.530
-- Not necessarily take technical capabilities but visual

125
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.900
-- version of what I'm thinking of.

126
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:33.560
Um

127
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.160
and

128
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.780
-- yeah just just my background in research and creativity and um and connection

129
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.720
-- in human connection has been a big piece of what's informed how this,

130
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.460
-- how the technical visual piece could work.

131
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.260
Um

132
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.960
-- Knowledge networks. To me it's just a natural extension right? Of

133
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.750
-- I need to know I'm researching this now and I want

134
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.160
-- to both store the knowledge that I know and I want to

135
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.980
-- expand on it where I can and then I want to

136
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.350
-- collaborate with other people on the parts I don't know yet.

137
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.430
-- And then eventually hopefully create something that benefits everybody.

138
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.120
-- And so to me that's the scaling scaffolding

139
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.240
-- Knowledge Network piece with a personal version and

140
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.010
-- a public version and maybe some hybrid versions

141
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.160
-- for groups that want to work privately together.

142
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.760
-- Yeah. And I hope

143
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.620
-- that justice and it made sense.

144
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:32.260
-- So Wendy, I put a link in there. Is that the app you're looking at?

145
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.950
-- Yes,
-- sir.

146
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.860
-- Mom,

147
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:42.420
-- I think there's a bit of discussion about it in in the Clambake channel to

148
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:42.700
-- go.

149
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.920
-- I gotta go, I guess I gotta

150
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.180
-- Yeah.

151
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.040
-- Okay. All right,

152
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.450
-- that's the one, yep.

153
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.560
-- And it's limited. I mean,

154
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.960
-- I met the

155
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.960
-- I met the one of the founders and

156
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:57.640
-- yeah,

157
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.160
-- there's just two guys. They just did it for fun.

158
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.460
-- They're in the middle of working on other stuff.

159
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.240
-- So, you know, I'm not sure how much development, it's going to get any time soon.

160
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.850
-- I was just super excited to see the visual version of it.

161
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.140
-- Yeah,

162
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:15.510
-- yeah.

163
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.290
-- If I could, if I could confine his visual the visual,

164
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.060
-- he's created in Wisdomtree and put it on like the brain

165
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.140
-- I would I would be happy.

166
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:30.630
-- I
-- was wondering about that visual because um I wonder if you've played

167
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:35.320
-- around with Obsidian and um they're graphic equalizer and there's actually two,

168
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.100
-- there's a there's the regular one and then there's a fancier one.

169
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.659
-- I have not yet

170
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.560
-- and you're the third person to reckon to recommend that to me this week.

171
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:49.330
-- So obviously
-- that's my name if you want to get together sometime

172
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.540
-- and play with the city and I'd be happy to do that.

173
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.060
-- Yeah that'd be great. Um

174
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.550
-- I also

175
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.550
-- Notice that the brain has a new version version 12,

176
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.560
-- I don't know how old that is or how familiar other people

177
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.160
-- are with it but I was just posting in the Clambake channel the

178
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.150
that

179
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.180
-- the enhancements they recently made to the brain

180
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.950
-- and version 12 really improved the U.

181
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:17.850
-- I. A lot

182
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.590
-- and I'm loving all the stuff that I'm seeing because it just

183
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.230
-- again brings it closer even closer to what I'm visualizing in my mind

184
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.830
-- and the features that I've I've outlined for the development that I

185
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.580
-- was planning on doing but now now I'm kind of collaborating instead.

186
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.560
Um

187
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.820
-- So I'm curious to know if if anybody else has been using the brain or you know what

188
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.200
-- other I know jerry and ask them a bunch

189
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.010
-- of questions but

190
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.260
-- we should we should have you over

191
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.560
-- to visit the free jerry's brain call where jerry,

192
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.960
-- it's people who are interested in

193
00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.450
-- um data,

194
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.860
-- uh graph knowledge bases I guess.

195
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.050
-- But we talked a fair bit about the brain and um,

196
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.670
-- there's jerry often comes and then Mark Trexler

197
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.250
-- who also has a very large brain that he

198
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.150
-- has semi commercialized.

199
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.250
-- Mm hmm.

200
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.390
-- They, you know, they know they know a lot about the brand,

201
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.530
-- their power users superpowers

202
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:19.950
And

203
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.070
-- did the climate version one, yeah, yeah. It was like a tattoo.

204
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.680
-- I remember they were talking about version 12 coming out a couple months ago,

205
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.760
-- and they were you know, there's some nice things that

206
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.210
-- so it is new.

207
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.360
-- Ok.

208
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.650
-- Um and you you can get stuff well actually,

209
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.050
-- um,

210
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.260
-- you can back up your brain

211
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.760
-- um to a reasonable data file, but then

212
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.650
-- the data file they don't really support

213
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.250
-- or they haven't documented the, you know,

214
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.160
-- export formats or anything where there's an api but it's kind of private.

215
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.750
-- It's not supposed to be public.

216
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.660
-- Um uh we have code though that does parse both the A. P. I and the

217
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.930
-- and the exports. The backups so it's possible to get data out of it.

218
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.660
-- Um but it's not friendly.

219
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.950
-- Yeah, I know. Vincent. That was my primary question.

220
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:21.260
-- You anticipated it because I know Vincent did that once he did a portion of it. Yeah.

221
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.060
-- Okay.

222
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.690
-- Um is the brain generally collaborative. This just one more question.

223
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.200
-- It's not multi player.

224
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.550
-- I think

225
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.030
-- that's a song where

226
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.730
-- that's the most sad making thing that jerry has right now That,

227
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.480
-- you know, he's very, um, the brain is a really good tool for him,

228
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.370
-- but he really wants to play with other people.

229
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:43.960
-- And so

230
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.660
-- yeah,

231
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.460
-- that would be, that's the biggest barrier for me

232
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.560
-- that in the data for medicine. Very open.

233
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.440
-- Yeah.

234
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:56.460
-- Bill.

235
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:57.840
-- Yeah.

236
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:08.660
-- I have questions. But you know, who wants to hear um,

237
00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:13.430
-- when you talked about how you reacted, when I talked visual thinking about,

238
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.130
-- I was typing too fast what you were really talking about?

239
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.750
-- Visualizing, thinking.

240
00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.260
-- And I'd like to hear more sometime or look at

241
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.460
-- more or have maybe a time to actually talk about

242
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.350
what

243
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.260
-- you're getting out there.

244
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.160
-- Because partially when I used to teach, I used to,

245
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.660
-- well it was graduate students, but I used to,

246
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.550
-- I used to assert

247
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.360
-- that they all knew

248
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.650
-- the best ways that they learn things

249
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.850
-- or had some idea what they were.

250
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.750
-- And so this thing about visualizing, thinking I,

251
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.050
-- I will,

252
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.560
-- I would like to know what works

253
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.260
-- talking about

254
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.830
-- because it's an actual activity.

255
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.060
-- Then I think,

256
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.060
-- you know, having some way of wandering through the warehouse in the storehouse

257
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.890
-- and making sense out of the two of them

258
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.780
-- you call trove of warehouse and factory store house.

259
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.560
-- And I'm like, okay, but

260
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.860
-- when we're thinking, what are we doing

261
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.960
-- that, you know, it could be about, I'm told it's not a task, but

262
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.760
-- sometimes I'm just looking at the clouds and you know,

263
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.260
-- ruminating.

264
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.560
-- Do you want to pick that up lending?

265
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.260
-- Yeah, sure.

266
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.770
-- It's a great question.

267
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:37.950
-- I think

268
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.980
-- it's interesting for me to have technical conversations around it.

269
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.360
-- So let me just kind of back up for a second and say I

270
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.460
-- understand the nature of most of the questions I've I've been I've been asked

271
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.060
-- from people who work with data

272
00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.550
-- are coming from a perspective where

273
00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.460
visualizing

274
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.950
-- using technology to visualize something usually means visualizing existing data

275
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.850
-- for me.

276
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.090
-- Because I came at this project from a

277
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:18.250
-- direction of positive psychology and that's fear.

278
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.660
-- I came at it from wanting to start from the place of the visual

279
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.860
-- and have the database be in the background

280
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.980
-- because I know the database needs to be there

281
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:34.000
-- right rather than it being a visual being a

282
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.530
-- way to better understand data that's already there.

283
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.010
-- I'm trying to use a visual interface to help me

284
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.810
-- create what I'm to help me see what I'm thinking.

285
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.850
-- Right? So yeah,

286
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:52.150
-- so if I'm really the storing of the knowledge is really just baseline, right?

287
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.750
-- Because I haven't had this tool already.

288
00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.030
-- If I had this tool already,

289
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.280
-- I would have been putting things into this user interface the

290
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.150
-- whole time and the storage would be there as a default.

291
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.250
-- But because we I haven't had it up to this point,

292
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.990
-- then I need something from which I can

293
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:12.080
-- maybe upload some some other documents or Excel,

294
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.160
-- file CSP files,

295
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.960
-- other things because I've been forced to store information that way so far.

296
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:23.950
-- But really I want to see it in this visual interconnected way because I have so many,

297
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.260
-- so much going on

298
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.260
-- and have gone down so many different

299
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.470
-- avenues of thought and started to realize how

300
00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.310
-- I researched into this area of positive psychology.

301
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.760
-- And then I researched over here into climate change and then I researched over here

302
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.420
-- into helping my community through Covid and some

303
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.220
-- of those pieces connected to each other,

304
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.210
-- but it was impossible to connect them.

305
00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.860
-- It would have been lovely if in the moment I could have gone soup,

306
00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.710
-- like I just connected those two things for me, I'm a visual person.

307
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:59.150
-- That's not everybody I get that. But because yeah,

308
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.850
-- you just wrote positive psychology and yeah, that's my that's my uh

309
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.760
-- that's that's basically taking the best of

310
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.860
-- how we think and what we do and and and

311
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.260
and

312
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.800
-- doing it more often making it more common in doing it more often.

313
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.670
-- So I'm trying to use technology to enable that, right?

314
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.810
-- So in my case,

315
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.560
-- it's creating these connections than that

316
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.960
-- are really the essence of creative thinking

317
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.910
-- and we are often at our best when we can

318
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.130
-- be creative and that's where solutions start to come from.

319
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.610
-- So I think there's a bunch of low hanging fruit,

320
00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.220
-- low hanging fruit being storing the knowledge, low hanging fruit being,

321
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.960
-- enabling people to get to solutions that have existed for a really long time,

322
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.770
-- but maybe they're not aware of it or they don't know about it.

323
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.480
-- And then it's then it's enabling people to be more creative, more innovative.

324
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.850
-- Again, it's a visual version of that.

325
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.580
-- I'm not saying that's the only way to do this,

326
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.060
-- but I'm saying it's a big piece that's

327
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.370
-- missing right now that technology could fill and

328
00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.220
-- for for those of us who would find a benefit in a tool like this?

329
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.940
-- I think we would usually benefit when I talked to Vincent about it,

330
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:11.380
-- we've come to a and Michael last week to it was there need to be different views.

331
00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:11.569
-- Right?

332
00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.410
-- Sometimes you need to see things in list form, sometimes you want to see a map view,

333
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.180
-- sometimes you want to look at the database itself.

334
00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.030
-- And I think those that would be a

335
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.240
-- valuable interfaces to have almost like toggles at the

336
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.369
-- top where you can switch between views or

337
00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:27.760
-- different views being presented at the same time.

338
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.170
-- And again, you know, the brain just kind of went there in the sense that you have the

339
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.290
-- you have the brain view on one side and you have the page view on the other.

340
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.090
-- So I think again,

341
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:44.020
-- some stuff like that's coming but circling back around my approach to it

342
00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.770
-- is from the visual view and not so much from the data view.

343
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:57.270
-- Um, if if I may, I kind of wanted to pick up and and to do kind of a parallel, um,

344
00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:03.460
-- rent or chat or whatever. Um, I've been for the for a week or two?

345
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.830
-- Maybe a little bit longer?

346
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:09.660
-- I've been talking about organizing information especially as relates to wikis.

347
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.170
-- Um and

348
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:18.290
-- um and I have I've been making a couple of assertions and part of it,

349
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.770
-- I I have a fairly strong position,

350
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:26.460
-- which is why I strengthen a little bit just to to be able to articulate it.

351
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:31.160
-- I don't think it's the only way to think are the only way that I don't know if it's true,

352
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.620
-- but I like to take a strong position and you know, and talk about that.

353
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.560
-- So my strong position is that

354
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.050
um

355
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.550
-- uh 111 thing is that the folks here,

356
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:50.190
-- people like us are all specialists and were able to use uh specialized tools,

357
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:55.660
-- uh like databases or like lists or like visualizations.

358
00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:56.760
Um

359
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.060
-- uh and most people uh

360
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.780
-- aren't specialists,

361
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.520
-- they're kind of human generalists and they get through life without using a

362
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.350
-- lot of the power tools that we kind of take for granted like

363
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:15.120
-- like wikis or like databases were like lists of things or streams of things.

364
00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:21.110
-- Um I think that specialization even goes out to reading and writing to me,

365
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.560
-- reading and writing is a specialization.

366
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.570
-- Um We all take it so much for granted that it seems like,

367
00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.450
-- well of course everyone reads and writes.

368
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:33.270
-- But if you think about it in your life, the people that you talk to,

369
00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.750
-- How many of them have written, you know, 10 pages,

370
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.270
-- how I haven't written 10 pages recently, right?

371
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.430
-- How many have written? How many have read 100 pages?

372
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.460
-- You know, in the past, you know, week or month or whatever, right?

373
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.560
-- Um, meeting and writing is kind of a specialization and we we forget that. I think

374
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.260
-- so, in the same way, I think that information organization,

375
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.950
-- um, uh,

376
00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.460
-- you have a piece of paper that goes in a file folder that goes in a

377
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.060
-- set of another file folders that goes in

378
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.960
-- the drawer that goes in a particular cabinet or

379
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.130
-- um, probably all of us are old enough to have used physical libraries.

380
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.020
-- Um,

381
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:15.070
-- I'm going to go look in the either the old physical card

382
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.000
-- catalogs where I'm going to look in the computer card catalog.

383
00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.170
-- I'm going to find a book about um elephants.

384
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:25.560
-- Um and then it's going to give me a coded address for a

385
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:31.460
-- physical location of a a floor and an aisle and a shelf,

386
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.290
-- and a section of that shelf where I can go and

387
00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:38.670
-- grab elephants and I can grab other books close to elephants.

388
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.360
-- Um, All of that. So

389
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.530
-- I think probably each of us grew up in

390
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.260
-- an environment where that was kind of just obvious.

391
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.060
-- That was kind of just something that everybody did.

392
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.060
So

393
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.480
-- when I see people pick up a wiki,

394
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:58.010
-- um I see them kind of recapitulating that thinking right.

395
00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.460
-- Um of course, of course everybody reads and writes.

396
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:06.660
-- Um of course everybody organizes things by categories or by hierarchy.

397
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:12.890
-- Um and that's and I come upon, you know, it's it's fairly common people are going,

398
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:16.660
-- okay, well I'm organizing information and here's my hierarchy, right?

399
00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:21.880
-- We don't start the conversation about what what information is, what knowledge is,

400
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.800
-- how we communicate.

401
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.160
-- We just go straight to this hierarchy. Right? Here's my hierarchy.

402
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.970
-- I'm comparing it to somebody else's hierarchy.

403
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.450
-- Mine is better than theirs or there's a better than mine. And

404
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.530
-- or I, I want to figure out how to map hierarchies.

405
00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:37.560
-- And I'm like, so the pitch in massive wikileaks and is like yeah,

406
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.090
-- hierarchies and even categories and stuff like that

407
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:45.770
-- aren't as interesting as connections links between uh information

408
00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:50.060
-- um uh and context. Um

409
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.410
-- so when I, when I talk to people about, you know,

410
00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:57.470
-- uh the question is how am I going to organize my information and my wicked.

411
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:58.770
-- And I'm like, well

412
00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.860
-- don't worry too much about organizing it, worrying,

413
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:07.140
-- worry about capturing it and improving the way it has been captured moving

414
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.140
-- up from kind of a stream of consciousness set of notes or thoughts,

415
00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.450
-- you know, improve that slowly over time.

416
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.330
-- And it could be like over weeks or months or years in a wiki, you know,

417
00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.360
-- where you start to cluster the information and

418
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.170
-- you start to connect it to other things.

419
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.780
-- Um And then look for ways that you connect information.

420
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.100
-- This stream of consciousness.

421
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:31.920
-- Oh this reminds me of other streams of consciousness had in the past.

422
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.170
-- And my wiki let me make it draw a link between them, right?

423
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.950
-- Um, uh,

424
00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.490
-- The, the, and then away that Wikis work,

425
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:50.230
-- especially when you get a number of people doing a wicked together,

426
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:54.850
-- which is something that we don't see anymore, but we do it all the time 15 years ago.

427
00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.860
-- Um,

428
00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.090
-- uh, there's an interesting thing that happens that people start thinking alike.

429
00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:06.260
-- They think in a group brain way. So I, I used to see this all the time.

430
00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.020
-- Um,

431
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.820
-- somebody would start to organize something a

432
00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.160
-- certain way and then somebody else would

433
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.360
-- pick up that organization and improve it a little bit or make it worse.

434
00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.170
-- Maybe a little bit,

435
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:20.220
-- they'd have some conversations around the edges in a chat system or in real life.

436
00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.490
-- And they'd say, oh,

437
00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:24.230
-- I saw that you started putting headers this way or I saw that

438
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:28.670
-- we started making links or I saw that we started having this convention of

439
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.730
-- naming pages a certain way. Here's my idea about that or I like that.

440
00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.520
-- And here's the thing that I'm going to do.

441
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.160
-- Another thing that's similar to that are different than that.

442
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.960
-- As we started working together wikis.

443
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.540
-- We have this collective way of managing information and organizing information

444
00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:49.170
-- and linking information and knowing kind of having body language around.

445
00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.740
-- Um, you know, you could, you could end up looking at somebody's page and,

446
00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.200
-- and kind of know what they were thinking about that page.

447
00:23:55.210 --> 00:24:00.230
-- Oh they kind of left it in a draft state and I know that I can improve it or you know,

448
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:04.080
-- this is a this is a page where they obviously have a strong opinion about it.

449
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.350
-- This is a rant and I'm not going to touch their rant except maybe to fixing typos.

450
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.460
-- What I'll do is I'll make a link to it.

451
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.370
-- Um and I'll have a separate rant on a separate page.

452
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.220
-- That kind of body language of, you know,

453
00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.630
-- what this information space means and what we're doing with it and things

454
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:22.870
-- like that is something that kind of improves and evolves over time.

455
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:26.470
-- And one of the things I I notice about

456
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.660
-- humans is that when we're doing culture together,

457
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.860
-- um it brings people closer together. It builds trust.

458
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:38.010
-- It builds relationships that we can rely on

459
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.850
-- and then build upon those relationships to do

460
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.760
-- a better job of keeping information, things like that.

461
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:44.860
-- Um,

462
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.500
-- one of the, some, some people will look at kind of the chatter,

463
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.890
-- the chit chat or the slow process of

464
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.970
-- organizing information kind of organically rather than,

465
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.410
-- you know, having a library sciences person come in and say, okay,

466
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.950
-- you've screwed up your information here is the way to do it.

467
00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:07.350
-- That's not really what I want out of my wikis. The wikis are participate in right?

468
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:10.610
-- Except you know, sometimes you need that there there are cases when you need that.

469
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.650
-- But in the main what you want is to have this

470
00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:17.980
-- culture forming that understands how the information is put together,

471
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:22.670
-- wants it to be better and works on that together and builds

472
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:28.060
-- human relationships about how we're doing that. And people are just slow that way.

473
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.980
-- And it's a good thing.

474
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.890
-- It's a really good thing when we go slow and we

475
00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.790
-- honor each other's trust and we honor relationships to one another.

476
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:36.670
-- And when we,

477
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:41.290
-- we make jokes about things or we tell people that we're upset about things.

478
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.310
-- I can't believe you stomped on my page. Why did you do that? You know?

479
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:49.560
-- And it's okay sometimes to be mad at somebody and you work things out right?

480
00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.820
-- Um, all of this stuff,

481
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:56.990
-- I'm kind of describing humans as they have been for thousands of years, right?

482
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.580
-- Tens of thousands of years.

483
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.880
-- If you think about humans and the way they

484
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.660
-- communicate and the way did they do knowledge.

485
00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.630
-- It's not written down. It's not in file folders. It's not in a library.

486
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.170
-- The way you human, the way you culture

487
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.270
-- is by

488
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.250
-- having emotional connections with one another. Having trust bonds.

489
00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:22.670
-- Social trust bonds with one another. And the way that you

490
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.150
-- communicate information is in what I call stories.

491
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.770
-- And when I say story, I mean probably something pretty small.

492
00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:36.100
-- Um, even as small as a single sentences to me. A story, right? Subject verb object.

493
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:39.060
-- Um uh,

494
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.570
-- last time grandma got too close to the bear cave,

495
00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:47.930
-- she got eaten you know or um or uh Auntie was out collecting

496
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:50.990
-- berries and then she found this new kind of berry which is awesome.

497
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.360
-- Um or she found this new kind of berry she ate some and she got sick.

498
00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:56.860
Um

499
00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.730
-- Those are the kinds of things that I think.

500
00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.270
-- So my another strong assertion I have is that

501
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.060
people

502
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:10.160
-- knowledge if I can use knowledge of the verb with stories.

503
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.770
-- And so all of the technical specialization tools that we have

504
00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:21.760
-- um are are largely not entirely but largely ways of

505
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:29.060
-- of story and maybe serializing a story into a form that you can pull out later.

506
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.900
-- So text when you write down a piece of text,

507
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:37.540
-- hopefully what you're doing is essentially your brain is

508
00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.950
-- telling a story of how something happened to you.

509
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:41.460
-- And then you

510
00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.470
-- you actually tell a story about the story that happened to you.

511
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.050
-- You can't really relate the thing that happened to you but

512
00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:49.270
-- you relate a story about it what it meant to you.

513
00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:56.270
-- And we have this trick where we we serialize language spoken language into text

514
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.800
-- and then later I can or somebody else can de

515
00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.350
-- serialize that back into speech and language and stories.

516
00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:08.710
-- And it's not the text that is the communicator.

517
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:12.480
-- It's actually the story that I tried to serialize into text

518
00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:15.530
-- and the story that somebody de serialize out of the text.

519
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.450
-- So the story there is the interesting part.

520
00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:22.050
-- Um So then something like a map of visualization is

521
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:25.670
-- kind of the same thing where you take um Yeah.

522
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.780
-- Uh you take a bunch of stories and you can put them in a visual

523
00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:35.550
-- space and you can and and but then the way that you use the map is

524
00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:41.920
-- me later looking at my map or somebody else, or me showing somebody else my map,

525
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.450
-- it's like A is connected to be this way

526
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.960
-- B is connected to C. And D. These ways.

527
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:52.090
-- And you you tell a story around the map,

528
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:56.310
-- and that's the value of the map is it's a way to

529
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:59.990
-- remind yourself of the stories that you can tell in that space.

530
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.960
-- The um And when you make a map and give it to somebody else,

531
00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.860
-- if you did a good job, what happens is that they can

532
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:15.070
-- brainstorm over the map that you've created and tell stories.

533
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.910
-- They can't look at a map and get all the visual relations,

534
00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:21.560
-- they don't get the relationships of all of that stuff

535
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.040
-- in a flash.

536
00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.720
-- What happens is they look at a map and they go,

537
00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.760
-- ok if I need to get from the Empire State Building

538
00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.490
-- uh to uh to the met,

539
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:38.000
-- what I have to do is find this station and use this line and then go to

540
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.950
-- this station and make a transfer and then go to another station and get out right,

541
00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.940
-- you tell yourself a story of how to navigate the map.

542
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.670
-- and that story again is the important part,

543
00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:54.740
-- the map is just a way of giving you hints about what the stories are,

544
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.440
-- right and where the stories are,

545
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.830
-- it helps you remember how many stories that you can get.

546
00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.360
-- It helps you synthesize new stories.

547
00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:06.260
-- You know, if somebody made a map of all the subway stations in new york,

548
00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.500
-- maybe that's not super useful to them or to you,

549
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:12.990
-- but when you can turn it into something like I need

550
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.610
-- to get from the Empire State Building to the mat,

551
00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.310
-- then you've synthesized the story out of it that they didn't write down,

552
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:22.530
-- they wrote down all the possible stories with the subway stations.

553
00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.660
-- But the story again, is the the interesting and important part.

554
00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:27.860
-- So then

555
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.610
-- one of the things that I observe with these visualizations,

556
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:37.550
-- graph visualizations of knowledge base is always look like junk to me.

557
00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.560
-- Um if they're automatically done

558
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:45.330
-- and it's I think what happens is that when you just have the machine say, okay,

559
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.850
-- here's all the connections.

560
00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.260
-- Um you didn't capture

561
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:54.380
-- the ability to do, you didn't capture a story, There wasn't a human that said,

562
00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.830
-- you know, this is a is connected to B.

563
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:58.250
-- And B. Is connected to C.

564
00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:02.800
-- And it's important because you just had a database query that said, okay,

565
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.450
-- split all the possible connections on the screen, right?

566
00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.760
-- Um and then maybe if you're lucky,

567
00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:13.460
-- some gravity forces kind of organized it into a way that is least objectionable.

568
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.860
-- But the

569
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.810
-- The process of just making a visualization doesn't make meaning.

570
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.890
-- It doesn't make stories and things like that,

571
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.880
-- it's when somebody comes along and curates that and says, Okay,

572
00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:28.770
-- so now I've got a picture of 200 nodes.

573
00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.890
-- Let me filter out the ones that aren't meaningful.

574
00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.670
-- Let me highlight the connections that are meaningful.

575
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.660
-- And here

576
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:43.680
-- MS reader is a story that I can tell out of this mismatch of big data.

577
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.450
-- I've I've curated it into stories.

578
00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.390
-- So my whole thing is is stories are the

579
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.880
-- way people think the way that people knowledge,

580
00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:55.560
-- we use specialized tools to help us story

581
00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.920
-- but we don't want to get distracted by the fact

582
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.080
-- that the tools that the tools aren't the story,

583
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.590
-- right?

584
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.950
-- Um the stories are still the story and the tools

585
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:09.560
-- just help us serialized stories and de serialized stories,

586
00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.060
-- so that's my pitch.

587
00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:12.770
-- Okay,

588
00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.060
-- Mark, I think maybe you're up next except your music

589
00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:26.770
-- are commuted.

590
00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:28.870
-- Sorry?

591
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.470
-- Um Yes, I am up next by hand uh signal,

592
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:35.270
-- but I'd love to hear responses to what Peter just said.

593
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.170
-- I I asked a question, I'm in the chat um

594
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.860
-- about stories

595
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:51.950
-- Um 20 I was in a conversation yesterday with uh some uh

596
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.770
-- um c t a uh

597
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:02.360
-- collaborative technology alliance um folks about um

598
00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:07.270
-- ontology ease and schemas and um

599
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.360
and

600
00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.460
-- was thinking out of what they were saying about

601
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:13.860
um

602
00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:20.260
-- trying to strip down to um

603
00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:21.840
-- yeah,

604
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:30.860
-- people, you know agents, those that can be profiled those that have agency

605
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.160
um

606
00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.050
-- for lack of a better word

607
00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.860
-- data, information

608
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.160
-- nodes, um

609
00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.830
-- a second category that is just stuff without agency but information

610
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:53.260
-- that gathers um metadata and stories I would say as well,

611
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.960
-- story elements as the

612
00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:03.170
-- accumulates, I mean things that stories can be told about um

613
00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.180
-- and then

614
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:10.050
-- containers, which is a much looser thing, which I wonder if it might include stories

615
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.260
-- um that when you

616
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.260
-- um take all these

617
00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:18.610
-- random books in the library um some of

618
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.010
-- which were they not constrained by physical space,

619
00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:24.780
-- might fit in multiple sections or might fit

620
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:28.260
-- together in different ways according to different people

621
00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:34.670
-- but you allow all these overlapping containers and stories

622
00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.960
-- to be created around them

623
00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.460
-- which um

624
00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:41.340
-- yeah,

625
00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:48.270
-- you know which of course their hair brain stories told about the same set

626
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:52.270
-- of facts but there's there's an inherent

627
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.260
-- vetting and building of reputation in seeing

628
00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:58.170
-- the gravity of

629
00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.760
-- the connection between certain facts.

630
00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:02.860
Um

631
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.890
-- data points, pieces of information

632
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.560
-- that different

633
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:15.760
-- agents have drawn in a story or by just tagging them the same way or by

634
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.460
-- just connections that they have drawn?

635
00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:20.560
Um

636
00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:21.670
-- Mhm.

637
00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.060
-- And I don't know if those three elements

638
00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:26.760
uh

639
00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:31.990
-- I see Bill, just asking the question what is the fact before is the fact, you know,

640
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.670
-- a data point an assertion which may be wrong, which you know and yes,

641
00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.250
incorrect

642
00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.670
-- data points can

643
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:48.480
-- build some gravity um around a story that certain people are telling each other,

644
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:53.830
-- but if you also have as as metadata around that item.

645
00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.260
-- Other people saying this is wrong

646
00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:01.750
-- um and other people with, with expertise in that area saying this is wrong,

647
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:07.250
-- that can be telling for people, if you if you go to that piece of data

648
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:09.950
-- in a random access way,

649
00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:13.150
-- there's a little bit of a story that an individual piece of data

650
00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:15.460
-- tells that

651
00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:20.450
-- that has the information that different agents has. The

652
00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:21.550
mhm

653
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:24.160
-- The containers um

654
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:28.850
-- iii stories, tags um groupings

655
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:34.850
-- that that different agents have put on it to say, wow this, this

656
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.160
-- alleged fact

657
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:38.550
is

658
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:43.760
-- um is associated with some things that other people say they are wrong

659
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.160
-- and the people who are expert in this field seemed to say that

660
00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.850
-- this is wrong. There's at least controversy here.

661
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:53.350
Um

662
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:54.160
mhm

663
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:58.050
-- You know, the visualization of this

664
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:59.450
-- can be

665
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.120
-- done in many ways.

666
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:09.350
-- Sorry, I'll stop. But I mean I just wanted to throw out the idea of

667
00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:10.450
um

668
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.870
-- that that random access quality being sort of

669
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:19.460
-- a leveler because anybody can just come upon

670
00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:24.040
-- whether digitally or in the world um

671
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:26.550
-- an item of information

672
00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:29.950
-- and if part of our job

673
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:35.050
-- and part of our job in creating interoperability is too

674
00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:37.150
-- associate as much

675
00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:44.550
-- metadata and as many stories and containers that have been put there by other people

676
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:48.840
-- um to let somebody find something and let them

677
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:50.160
-- use the

678
00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:52.890
-- all the spokes, all the edges

679
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.240
-- that come out of it

680
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:59.850
-- to find people find related information,

681
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.250
-- dispute it.

682
00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:02.450
Um

683
00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:03.540
No

684
00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.540
-- find the stories that are built around it.

685
00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.750
-- Um I think that's it's a little bit our job.

686
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:13.530
-- Mhm.

687
00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:16.450
-- Mhm.

688
00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:26.030
-- Um Thanks Michael and uh thanks Peter. These are both great um

689
00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:32.800
-- notions I am fairly known um or at least uh unfairly known,

690
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:39.970
-- fairly unknown for basically um trying to take

691
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:42.250
-- the position that it's not all stories,

692
00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:47.150
-- its context, it's different types of

693
00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:51.330
-- elements, statements, um

694
00:38:52.420 --> 00:39:00.250
-- oppositional propositions, big propositions questions. Um

695
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.440
-- and I find the story focus to be

696
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:13.670
-- um in the study of how we basically grow an understanding to be a limited kind of view.

697
00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.940
-- Um I just

698
00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.140
um

699
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:22.420
-- I'll try I'll just put that out there and and come back to it later,

700
00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.940
-- but I certainly appreciate um

701
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:29.040
-- the slow culture

702
00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.330
-- vision of or

703
00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.840
-- um story or example that Peter told.

704
00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:46.150
-- Um I posted a James Maxwell quotations um and I'll just post the quotation um

705
00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:52.530
-- uh in there basically. Um and I'll read it out,

706
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.530
-- It's part of a 19

707
00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.340
-- 78. Um

708
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:06.530
-- I'm looking for the encyclopedia Britannica where apparently this um

709
00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:11.570
-- quote on entropy is but let me read it out

710
00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:16.310
-- a memorandum book does not provided it is neatly written,

711
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.830
-- appear confused

712
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:20.440
-- to an illiterate person

713
00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:23.940
-- or to the owner who understands it

714
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:25.490
-- thoroughly,

715
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:29.330
-- but to any other person able to read it.

716
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:33.940
-- It appears to be inextricably confused.

717
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.750
-- So we've all had the experience of being in

718
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:42.030
-- class and sharing notes with other people and basically

719
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:46.650
-- some people's notes are clear and understandable to us.

720
00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:49.430
-- Other people's notes are Impenetrable.

721
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:51.830
-- Um And

722
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:55.030
-- what I love about this quote is it's in the middle of

723
00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:57.740
-- available a discussion of entropy,

724
00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:01.070
-- available energy and dissipated energy is heat.

725
00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:08.530
-- And this uh notion of organization is linked to

726
00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:16.130
-- the states of motion of atoms. But anyway the this little chunk

727
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:18.400
-- really puts out

728
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:19.240
a

729
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:24.380
-- a case to tie back to what Peter was

730
00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:29.550
-- talking about about some kind of collaborative culture where we

731
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:37.100
-- learn each other's signs and organizational systems and adapt mutually

732
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.240
-- to each other so that we can have an artifact

733
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:42.330
-- that is mutually meaningful.

734
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:43.820
Now

735
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:51.070
-- whether that can be done on a website like factor or even Wikipedia.

736
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.880
-- Uh people are actually doing that.

737
00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:59.630
-- People are actually developing different ways of communicating.

738
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.120
Um

739
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.420
-- When I was involved with

740
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.430
-- 03 d. um

741
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.520
-- vernal Vrml

742
00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.020
um

743
00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.620
-- it was an idea to create three D. Spaces on the web

744
00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.020
-- and like html. You could cut and paste to make your own stuff.

745
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:29.110
-- But I went to architecture school and learn how to think in three dimensions.

746
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.140
-- People can

747
00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.930
-- do the writing

748
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.230
-- of html

749
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:39.510
-- and the reading of html in a browser very

750
00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.450
easily

751
00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.010
-- to actually create visual

752
00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:50.090
-- or at least I'll use the three D. Example to create spatial three D.

753
00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:51.930
-- Spaces that make sense.

754
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:58.290
-- Um It was an authoring problem. You could not author a three D.

755
00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:06.780
-- Space as easily as you could the two D. Web page and it kind of fizzled out and and died.

756
00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:07.430
So

757
00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.050
-- certainly what I'm trying to point out are to

758
00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:16.120
-- the two aspects of creating the shared knowledge bases,

759
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.050
-- the writing part and the reading

760
00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:19.730
-- part.

761
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.810
-- Um They're not

762
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:28.400
-- always as clear as we might ourselves

763
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.310
-- imagine when it comes to involving other people

764
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:39.620
-- and um certainly um I loved what uh Michael and and peter we're talking about. Um

765
00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.930
-- and unfortunately I've got to go in about four minutes but

766
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.510
-- uh thanks for listening.

767
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.010
-- Thanks mike.

768
00:43:59.600 --> 00:43:59.810
-- Yes.

769
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:03.400
-- Um along with the Mexico code. Thank you mark.

770
00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:07.810
-- Um I wanted to share a Kafka letter, franz kafka letter.

771
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:09.510
-- Um It

772
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:14.720
-- came up in the context of a smaller part of the quote of it, but it's a fun,

773
00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:15.290
-- yeah,

774
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:16.910
-- it's a fun letter.

775
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:19.310
-- It's in german so you have to

776
00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:21.720
-- you have to translate it. But

777
00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:22.920
um

778
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:31.440
-- uh the small quote was um words or really a book. A book must be the

779
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.110
-- ice axe for the frozen sea within us.

780
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:35.110
Ah

781
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:37.310
-- The whole letter is lovely

782
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:40.220
-- and I won't,

783
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:41.100
-- I mean

784
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:43.720
-- grab it and grab it and translate it.

785
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:50.610
-- That's not the that's the pull quote but that's not the best part of it.

786
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:51.290
-- Yeah,

787
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:53.800
-- instant.

788
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:58.260
Hello

789
00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.190
-- everyone.

790
00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.090
-- I have like a

791
00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.610
-- half baked thought um

792
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:07.110
-- whenever I

793
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:12.800
-- find information or stories that are really interesting.

794
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:14.420
Um

795
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:17.420
-- My
-- one of my first

796
00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:23.610
-- kind of urges is to like save it in a place where I know I can find it later

797
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:25.910
-- and I don't know

798
00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.310
-- if that

799
00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:37.680
-- like almost like a bad learned habit because life is too demanding and we don't have

800
00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:42.000
-- the time when we come across something we like to actually like sit with it.

801
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:48.230
-- It's like, you know, you come across like a patrick berry's, but there's like a,

802
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.220
-- you know, a wild tiger chasing you and so you can look at it,

803
00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:54.210
-- take a mental note of where it is and then you have to keep running away.

804
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:59.100
-- And so I don't know if that's um and like a realistic

805
00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:06.260
-- uh analogy um because maybe will never be in

806
00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.150
-- a time where we can actually go through things.

807
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:09.800
-- But yeah, I very rarely

808
00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:15.450
-- um there's this one tool I use called refined when I open a new tab and it shows me

809
00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:19.010
-- like really interesting articles and occasionally I'll like open

810
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:21.080
-- up one of those articles and and read it,

811
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:23.560
-- but most of the times I'll save it for later and then when

812
00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.100
-- I do have the time I will open it up and read it.

813
00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:31.830
-- Um But yeah, like for me, there's like almost two separate processes,

814
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:33.200
-- there's the process of like

815
00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:36.620
-- being emergent engaged in stories which is like the

816
00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:39.040
-- actual juicy stuff like that's like the berries.

817
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.090
-- It's what you live for,

818
00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.040
-- but then there's like a whole other process which is like, all right,

819
00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.500
-- we're like hunting for

820
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:49.100
-- the stories for the berries. It's like, and that's that time

821
00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.910
-- is kind of unknown.

822
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:53.800
-- You know when you're going to come across something and so

823
00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:57.700
-- I feel like having an information system which actually can help me

824
00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:01.100
-- take that unknown and make it a little bit more known.

825
00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.120
-- Like when I search for something on Google,

826
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.220
-- I'm not sure if it's going to be on the first result of the page or it's

827
00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:10.800
-- going to be on the like 107th page or I'm not going to find it at all.

828
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:15.800
-- Um So having a way to like search and find information that's like

829
00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:21.330
-- reliable, that when you do want to like sit down and engage with the story, you know,

830
00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:22.210
-- you could find it.

831
00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:26.750
-- Um like last night I spent a half an hour looking on like, you know,

832
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:29.090
-- four different websites for a movie to watch that

833
00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.100
-- was on netflix and that

834
00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.130
-- um wasn't over two hours because we don't have that much time.

835
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:39.230
-- Uh and that was not super action

836
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.710
packed

837
00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.690
-- because I
-- actually got into a surfing incident.

838
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.970
-- I was like super adrenaline adrenaline filled and I wanted

839
00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:49.630
-- something relaxing uh ended up just watching Planet Earth because

840
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:56.250
-- that was the only thing that I knew was I knew it was there uh that met the criteria,

841
00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:01.090
-- but I couldn't actually find what I was looking for and um yeah, so that's kind of

842
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:03.870
-- information management tools and wikis

843
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:06.380
-- aren't just about the stories.

844
00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:11.200
-- I think they're also about finding the stories and that process could be different.

845
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.080
-- Um,

846
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:22.200
-- I'll jump in and nobody else's.

847
00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:23.790
-- Uh, I would

848
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:27.690
-- love to come back to that first thing you said Vincent about,

849
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:30.200
-- about running from the tiger and

850
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:34.690
-- and you know, not having time to deal with the berries. Um,

851
00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:41.000
-- I think the stories that we tell

852
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:45.580
-- and the things, the information than that each of these agents

853
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:48.790
-- gathers in the random way that they do.

854
00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:52.890
-- Like, I'm running from a tiger. There's some berries. Mental note.

855
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:55.000
-- I'm throwing that in the,

856
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:58.580
-- the food full older

857
00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:01.690
-- that that

858
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:06.930
-- association of food and place,

859
00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:10.190
-- were it like where it's something that you could look at,

860
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:12.900
-- where somebody else who was running from a different tiger,

861
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:18.400
-- you know, in a different direction. You would never go back maybe to that,

862
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.690
that

863
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:21.290
-- berry tree

864
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:25.580
-- because there are tigers around there. But uh

865
00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:31.430
-- um if that information were recorded,

866
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:36.550
-- if that metadata were recorded and layered on

867
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:39.630
-- the metadata of other people doing different things,

868
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:43.840
-- some of whom weren't running from tigers and had time to stop

869
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.690
-- and taste the berries and say these berries are really good.

870
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:51.760
-- And that were mapped in a way that said there seemed to be

871
00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.950
-- a lot of these berry trees that a couple of people have said,

872
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:55.900
-- we're really good

873
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:57.580
-- in this area.

874
00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:00.380
-- The north part of it has lots of tigers in it.

875
00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.710
-- But the south part of it, you know,

876
00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.530
-- this is the way that knowledge emerges and stories

877
00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:10.680
-- emerge from just one random bit of metadata.

878
00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:15.690
-- That could be the metadata that is you putting it in a folder for later.

879
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:18.110
-- You know what I'm saying? And

880
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:18.990
and

881
00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:20.490
that

882
00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.580
-- kind of layered

883
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.780
-- interactive non storytelling, just container

884
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.390
-- placing.

885
00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:30.390
Um

886
00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.490
-- seems seems to me

887
00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.070
-- something,

888
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:35.990
-- there's something there.

889
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.470
-- So please please keep uh maybe it's not yielding much yet,

890
00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.960
-- but please keep putting those things you see into

891
00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.460
-- a container or tagging them or you know,

892
00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.390
-- and I think we all should and then we have to figure out

893
00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:48.780
-- how we can all see it.

894
00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:49.780
-- Mhm.

895
00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.080
-- By mark.

896
00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.570
-- Okay, I'll jump in. So

897
00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:03.870
-- I'm gonna go back to something I posted and then bring it back ground

898
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:05.440
-- to stories and everything everybody is talking

899
00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.380
-- about because I find this super interesting.

900
00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:13.690
-- So I think what I'm hearing and what everyone is saying is we're talking about

901
00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:16.110
-- capturing and storing knowledge

902
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:19.180
-- in different phases. I guess I would call the phases

903
00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:23.580
-- where and so what I posted before was sometimes we want to just get to a resource

904
00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:26.520
-- right? Either it's a piece of information we need right now.

905
00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.300
-- We don't really care about it other times.

906
00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:32.620
-- Or just curious or a friend post pointed us to something but it's not really our

907
00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:37.980
-- thing or we just told we need to learn something for some reason or whatever.

908
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:40.970
-- Right? We just need we just need information that already exists.

909
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:43.580
-- We need to get it from a book or website or something

910
00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:48.840
-- to me that's a very different process then

911
00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:51.520
-- I'm exploring something that I really love.

912
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:53.530
-- It's a new hobby or I'm more interested in,

913
00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:56.950
-- the more I explore it and I want to go deeper and I want to go broader and I want to,

914
00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:57.400
-- you know,

915
00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:02.230
-- I want to remember what I thought of three months ago when I was researching this,

916
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:04.180
-- but then got sidetracked from researching this,

917
00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:05.480
-- that kind of

918
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:07.070
knowledge

919
00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:09.180
-- storing and learning.

920
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:13.710
-- And then we sometimes want to explore something that really no one knows yet,

921
00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.560
-- or there's very little information about

922
00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:18.430
-- and then, and that's a completely different thing.

923
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:21.100
-- I completely agree with the threat of stories.

924
00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:22.980
-- I don't know that we always think about it,

925
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:24.680
-- but I do think

926
00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:28.000
-- all the research and psychology even points to the fact

927
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.030
-- that we're always creating a story in our mind.

928
00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.350
-- We have a story about how we feel about things.

929
00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.610
-- We have a story about who we are, we have a story about what our origin is.

930
00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:41.290
-- We have a story about how we see the world that provides the filters and

931
00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:43.810
-- the perspectives that we have on the world

932
00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.300
-- and whether we're consciously conscious of it,

933
00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:46.760
-- sorry,

934
00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:51.480
-- whether we're conscious of it or not, we are forming those stories all the time

935
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:56.150
-- and I don't know yet whether technology would

936
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:59.570
-- benefit us and pointing out that process or simply

937
00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:04.300
-- just presenting us the pathways with which to to get to where we need to go.

938
00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:06.260
-- But I think both are valuable and I

939
00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.260
-- I guess what I'm trying to say is

940
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:13.060
-- all of these things are important. All of them have value.

941
00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:16.350
-- Whether we're just passing something by and we need to put it, you know,

942
00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.770
-- there we saw the berries and we were racing by

943
00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:21.880
-- and so we think we need to store it

944
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:26.980
-- um for later when we're hungry and we're not being chased by a tiger.

945
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:29.180
-- But what if

946
00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:32.870
-- somebody else had already stored that knowledge for us and we

947
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:37.460
-- could trust that our society had that knowledge stored for us.

948
00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:39.970
-- So we didn't even have to waste the energy

949
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:41.270
-- to storing

950
00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:42.180
-- that.

951
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.860
-- We could go find it when we needed it and we could trust that

952
00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:48.490
-- we could find it when we needed it when when it was important and

953
00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:52.750
-- it might even then be surrounded with the best time to go is in

954
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:55.970
-- the spring when the tigers have moved away and there's no one around,

955
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:56.190
-- right?

956
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:59.680
-- And you can take your time gathering in fact, and then here's how to

957
00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:03.320
-- process the barriers so that the last of the winter so that when the tigers are there,

958
00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.360
-- you don't have to like

959
00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:08.450
-- that. Yes, that to me is the ideal, right?

960
00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:12.520
-- It's let's guess past the point where we reach curating for ourselves,

961
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:13.850
-- there will always be that piece.

962
00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.670
-- But we're also curating for each other

963
00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:22.160
-- simply because I already curated it for myself, why not give it to you as well? Right.

964
00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:26.970
-- It's common knowledge now. So to me that's the juicy spots, right.

965
00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:30.550
-- Whether we want to frame it in stories or not. Stories. To me, it's more valuable

966
00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:34.250
-- to frame it in what kind of phase I'm in?

967
00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:40.120
-- Am I in a phase of I just need some information and I am I in a phase where I'm really deep

968
00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.850
-- diving into something and I want to use use the interface

969
00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:48.550
-- or the community or the interaction or whatever to really learn something

970
00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:49.800
-- deeply.

971
00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:53.260
-- Am I in a phase of creating something brand new

972
00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.360
-- if I were to try to break it down into three.

973
00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:58.750
-- But I think there's it's a continuum really?

974
00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:00.240
-- Yeah.

975
00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.170
-- Any thoughts

976
00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:25.260
-- off of um what was being said in the chat here? Um

977
00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:30.380
-- what Vincent was saying of who do you curate for? Who are you waiting for? You?

978
00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:32.170
-- Others both? Um

979
00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.170
that

980
00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:36.960
-- mm hmm.

981
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:40.350
-- It's really interesting. One of the, one of the uh

982
00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:45.760
-- the use cases, the user stories um

983
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.160
that

984
00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:55.670
-- we imagined for factor in early days where our orientation was more

985
00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:56.670
um

986
00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:02.450
-- um related. NGO gathering um

987
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:04.660
-- gathering information.

988
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.840
-- So that

989
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:10.480
-- people on the ground in one place, we're seeing the same things that you know,

990
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:12.250
-- somebody in new york was seeing

991
00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:13.450
um

992
00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:15.450
and

993
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:18.250
-- realizing that some of the

994
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:21.160
-- data that needed to be gathered

995
00:56:21.830 --> 00:56:24.520
-- would be gathered by people who didn't know what

996
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:28.970
-- its significance was and that had to be surfaced.

997
00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:33.460
-- Like somebody in Sierra Leone takes a picture of

998
00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:38.750
-- somebody's arm and says you know what the hell is this this

999
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:44.350
-- disease that's forming on you know not not being a part of a U. N. Team. Not

1000
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:47.960
-- being anything. Just just wanting to like say hey

1001
00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:50.550
-- berries on this bush, you know,

1002
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:53.240
-- I don't know what it means where it fits.

1003
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:58.540
-- I'm not sure this is for me or for you or for the greater world but just

1004
00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:00.240
-- you know, data point.

1005
00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:01.740
Um

1006
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:03.240
and

1007
00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:06.660
-- so you know that we don't really know

1008
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:09.270
-- why were gathering,

1009
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.860
-- you know not all of us are information gatherers but we're

1010
00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:15.960
-- kind of all information gatherers and the easier it is for

1011
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.950
everybody

1012
00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:18.850
to

1013
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:20.850
-- share their information.

1014
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:23.450
-- If it's not something they need to keep private

1015
00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:27.900
-- um without knowing what its significance is. Without knowing where it fits.

1016
00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:30.460
-- I mean the metadata on

1017
00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:34.910
-- the very photograph for the skin photograph could just be

1018
00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:38.050
-- a date and a location and that's all there is.

1019
00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:40.690
-- But somebody who is researching because they're doing

1020
00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:44.340
-- a deep dive and looking for examples of

1021
00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:46.250
-- berries in this region,

1022
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:49.450
-- you know, I can find that. Um

1023
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:52.960
-- Yeah so um

1024
00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:53.740
-- yeah.

1025
00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:59.050
-- Um just to what Wendy, what you were saying about um

1026
00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:03.710
-- I don't have to gather this information because

1027
00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.650
-- um because somebody else has already gathered it.

1028
00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:13.840
-- I find the information that other people have already gathered because

1029
00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:14.840
I

1030
00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:19.950
-- gather this piece of information that I don't know. I don't know where it fits.

1031
00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:24.040
-- But I find out where it fit from from the other people.

1032
00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:25.150
-- Um,

1033
00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:29.950
-- you know, picture of at a more mature state.

1034
00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:35.650
-- A picture of a berry in this place brings up all this information about,

1035
00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:39.810
-- you know, recipes for how to cook that barry, how to dry it for the winter.

1036
00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:41.150
-- As you were saying, you know,

1037
00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:47.140
-- watch out for the tigers, all kinds of stuff. So yeah,

1038
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.240
-- I think we're

1039
00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:51.330
-- we're getting some good stuff here.

1040
00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:57.750
So

1041
00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:02.150
-- sorry, go.

1042
00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:09.330
-- Okay. So

1043
00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:12.700
-- I'm having a bit of a hard time with this

1044
00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:15.150
-- conversation because I don't really don't have to think about it

1045
00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:18.040
-- literally.

1046
00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:22.250
-- So I

1047
00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:24.950
-- maybe I'll make some notes and send them out.

1048
00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:28.020
-- But I um a little confused about this word story

1049
00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:30.180
-- which has now become so big that it has,

1050
00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:31.840
-- it's losing its meaning for me

1051
00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:36.950
-- or the meeting I used to have. So I'm a little confused there.

1052
00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.650
-- Although I actually believe everything you're saying.

1053
00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:41.950
-- Okay,

1054
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:46.750
-- all right, just I'm getting kind of unhinged here. So in a way that

1055
00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:48.540
-- isn't helpful

1056
00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:50.750
and

1057
00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:52.740
-- so I don't really,

1058
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:59.240
-- I don't know I have. This is so it's quite generative, you know, this is a really rich

1059
01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:01.930
-- conversation, but I think

1060
01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:08.620
-- for me at least it's going to take a lot of work to come up with

1061
01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:10.440
-- to make sense of

1062
01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:12.430
-- just what we've talked about

1063
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:16.940
-- and the idea of looking things up because I've seen this very what is it

1064
01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:19.070
-- in the neighborhood, I live in texas,

1065
01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:22.740
-- people just take pictures of snakes in their garden and posted on facebook.

1066
01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:27.130
-- You know, many of my wife or the snake Wrangler comes back. Oh that's just a

1067
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:28.730
-- that's just a rat snake.

1068
01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:32.730
-- You love those things, They eat things you don't want around in new york.

1069
01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:33.530
-- Mhm.

1070
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:35.240
-- You know, so people

1071
01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:36.930
-- don't expect

1072
01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:38.940
-- to find it online,

1073
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:43.430
-- they expect some neighbor to go, oh that thing,

1074
01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:46.640
-- you know, don't worry, it's not interested in you,

1075
01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.940
-- like the rattlesnake, which is like you want to come,

1076
01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.030
-- you want you want a piece of me come and take it

1077
01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:53.440
-- right,

1078
01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:56.740
-- most snakes are like, there's a big two legged I think home

1079
01:00:57.210 --> 01:00:57.740
-- I think of

1080
01:00:58.310 --> 01:00:59.530
-- hideout.

1081
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:03.440
-- So I'm just saying that I think this is super rich

1082
01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:09.930
-- and I don't know how to make sense of it. I'm not sure, I agree with all the assertions.

1083
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:12.230
So

1084
01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:17.370
-- the way to make sense of it is to keep talking and obviously not necessarily,

1085
01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:18.580
-- we can do a day synchronously.

1086
01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:22.020
-- But then the other the other trick of that is to remember what we're talking about

1087
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:25.030
-- um which is going to end up maybe in text.

1088
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.740
-- Okay.

1089
01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:28.020
-- Yeah, and I

1090
01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:29.030
-- wow.

1091
01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:32.120
-- Yeah.

1092
01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:33.440
-- Well,

1093
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:38.440
-- I don't know, maybe later this week, I'll find out

1094
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:40.800
-- when I know that I'm actually thinking

1095
01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.630
-- rather than doing something else

1096
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:46.140
-- that would help if I could say, oh now I'm thinking

1097
01:01:47.010 --> 01:01:47.430
-- Mhm.

1098
01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:49.630
-- As opposed to what bill?

1099
01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:50.820
Uh

1100
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:52.820
-- daydreaming?

1101
01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:57.430
-- Um It's super interesting, so thanks, thanks,

1102
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.640
-- thanks for it.

1103
01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.750
-- Yeah, so as you were talking about,

1104
01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:09.520
-- I think I might have an example that might help because it's in the

1105
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.430
-- realm of education.

1106
01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.310
-- So I always pictured

1107
01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:16.620
of

1108
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
-- visual interface, let's say you're a teacher,

1109
01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.920
-- the traditional model and you can please feel free to correct me. Would be

1110
01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:29.920
-- I as the teacher know the body of knowledge that I need to cover in a semester,

1111
01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.620
-- I'm going to start here

1112
01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:35.120
-- and I'm going to go through this path to get here.

1113
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:39.420
-- We're going to take some branches if I think they're important tangents

1114
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:42.520
-- to help people understand of course I'll take questions and stuff.

1115
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:45.010
-- But it basically had my curriculum mapped out.

1116
01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:48.420
-- I've got my exercises, I've got my group work, I've got my

1117
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.390
-- labs have got whatever,

1118
01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.930
-- even maybe a field trip thrown in there to help integrate the knowledge right?

1119
01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.430
They

1120
01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.020
if

1121
01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:03.390
-- I could take what I am visualizing and give it to a teacher,

1122
01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.230
-- this is how I can imagine it working.

1123
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.350
-- I'm a teacher,

1124
01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:14.470
-- I plan a couple days in advance with a visual representation of the knowledge,

1125
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:16.920
-- I plan to teach and its smallest

1126
01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:18.930
-- beginner form,

1127
01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.010
-- I've just say a node

1128
01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.810
-- and a couple of connections.

1129
01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:30.120
-- On day one we talk intro, we meet each other, all that normal stuff and for homework,

1130
01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:32.520
-- the kids assignment are to add

1131
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:34.730
-- one thing

1132
01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.930
-- to the tree, collaboratively

1133
01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.420
-- Add one piece of information.

1134
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:42.980
-- The discussion is why did you add that piece of information and how

1135
01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:45.430
-- does it relate to the topic that we're talking about in class?

1136
01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:48.230
-- That could happen at a regular basis

1137
01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.780
-- over the course of a semester at the end of every semester,

1138
01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:53.930
-- the tree of

1139
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.030
-- curated knowledge around the topic from which we've

1140
01:03:57.030 --> 01:04:00.450
-- been learning looks different every single time,

1141
01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:00.720
-- right?

1142
01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.310
Because

1143
01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:03.810
-- of what different students will add

1144
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:05.920
-- and why they added it.

1145
01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:08.920
-- The why they added it is the story

1146
01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:15.180
-- I added this piece because I was it made me think of block. Right?

1147
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.360
-- So history,

1148
01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:21.670
-- but it made me one student think of how her family cooks and she ends up adding a

1149
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:24.540
-- recipe and a little story about how this particular

1150
01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.880
-- recipe fits into history and where it came from,

1151
01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:31.060
-- either from her family or or from the food or whatever.

1152
01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:34.790
-- Whereas another kid goes off into politics and talks about, you know,

1153
01:04:34.790 --> 01:04:38.240
-- wants to integrate what's happening now with what happened then.

1154
01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:42.920
-- Right. And and that becomes the story and that story line even if

1155
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:44.810
-- not only helps us

1156
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:48.900
-- learn because that's how we think even when we're not conscious of it,

1157
01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:50.360
-- we think in associations,

1158
01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.500
-- we learn much better when we connect a piece of

1159
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:55.490
-- information as you probably well know right to something else.

1160
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:57.940
-- We already know that if it's a piece of information is just

1161
01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:01.160
-- kind of floating around there and doesn't seem to connect to anything.

1162
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:05.750
-- So it's helping literally build those connections in ways

1163
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:09.010
-- that are meaningful to the people in the room?

1164
01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:11.610
-- I don't know if that helps or not. But

1165
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.800
-- that's the way I think.

1166
01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:17.850
-- Yeah that's genius actually. Um And when I was teaching at the U. K.

1167
01:05:17.850 --> 01:05:21.310
-- It was a graduate level course on scientific data informatics.

1168
01:05:21.690 --> 01:05:24.720
-- You know I've shared that big list of mind maps

1169
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:27.800
-- but that's exactly how the car this course started

1170
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:30.110
-- with a little scalpel bagram.

1171
01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:31.220
Uh

1172
01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:34.600
-- Now I didn't have I wasn't you know when we're

1173
01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.720
-- trying to talk about what's this you know the information

1174
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:42.010
-- was the information properties of scientific data.

1175
01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:46.220
-- I just would tell the class. I said look there's no textbook

1176
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:49.610
-- we are here on our own.

1177
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:55.920
-- And I would say my goal for you is to have a worthwhile learning experience.

1178
01:05:57.090 --> 01:05:58.110
-- Then he hitches

1179
01:05:58.790 --> 01:05:59.810
-- I can't do it for you.

1180
01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.700
-- You're going to have to do it for you.

1181
01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.990
-- I'm gonna have a great one because I always do because

1182
01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.490
-- I'm interested

1183
01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.600
-- in that. But

1184
01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:13.910
-- so that's the way I didn't really have the idea of

1185
01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.060
-- if I were doing it now I think I would have

1186
01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.490
-- more technology to help people actually build an annotated kind of

1187
01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:24.300
-- I know some monster. I would actually build a wiki

1188
01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:25.910
of

1189
01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:28.000
-- the results of

1190
01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:29.910
-- you know these whatever

1191
01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.400
-- 15 weeks of

1192
01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:33.800
interacting

1193
01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.200
-- but yes I mean I think that is

1194
01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:39.700
-- you know.

1195
01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:43.500
-- Yeah. Well so yes I agree. I mean

1196
01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.400
-- I did that.

1197
01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:54.000
-- Yes. So does that clarify story to you, because that was where you were?

1198
01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:58.170
-- Yeah, that's a nice idea, just but I don't know,

1199
01:06:58.170 --> 01:07:01.400
-- in this conversation it got super big, like a pumpkin.

1200
01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:02.890
-- Yeah,

1201
01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:05.370
-- which is something lucy,

1202
01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:09.320
-- such minutes eric spark used to talk to the tech people about interoperability,

1203
01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:12.910
-- she used to say it's like a big idea, it's like it's like a pumpkin.

1204
01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:14.790
-- Yeah,

1205
01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.800
-- because you know,

1206
01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:22.590
-- my wife was there to just to push back on the tech people like what,

1207
01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:23.800
-- what are you talking about

1208
01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:25.000
-- this?

1209
01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:28.850
-- Yeah, and I think again, it's multilayered, right?

1210
01:07:28.850 --> 01:07:32.230
-- I have my individual story about myself, I have the story about this classroom,

1211
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:33.400
-- of the story about the teacher,

1212
01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.440
-- the story about what I'm learning that either provides

1213
01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.450
-- it meaning or makes me think it's stupid.

1214
01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:42.270
-- And then, and to me it's the it's the scaling up version of that, you know,

1215
01:07:42.270 --> 01:07:44.790
-- Wendy Alford's version of that would be,

1216
01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.380
-- we're a top,

1217
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:50.260
-- we're trying to look top down on a

1218
01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:54.340
-- very complicated situation and if we collect stories,

1219
01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:55.490
-- we can

1220
01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:00.780
-- makes sense out of the threads that exist and

1221
01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:04.120
-- see into what other people aren't seeing within them,

1222
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:07.450
-- within their own, within their own frame of experience, right?

1223
01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:11.800
-- So it's still it's sense making a larger story, which until computers came along,

1224
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.190
-- really,

1225
01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:15.740
-- the only way you could do that was sit around a fire and share and share stories,

1226
01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:20.550
-- right, and see where the thread was now she's taught, she's able to find the thread.

1227
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:24.490
-- So instead of a threat of knowledge weaving through the semester of a classroom,

1228
01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.300
-- going slightly in one direction or slightly in the other direction,

1229
01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:31.819
-- depending on the students, you now have an entire community, a city,

1230
01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:36.680
-- an organization or whatever, who are also going in one direction and if

1231
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:38.770
-- management thinks they're going in this direction,

1232
01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:40.260
-- but they're actually going in this direction,

1233
01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:42.910
-- that's worthwhile knowing because otherwise we're solving the wrong

1234
01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:45.390
-- problems are putting our energy in the wrong ways.

1235
01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:49.300
-- Yeah, well, I just want to add one thing, I'm going to have to jump off in it.

1236
01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:50.680
-- Well, maybe another five minutes. But

1237
01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:54.680
-- so the one thing that I came up for me, I didn't type them in.

1238
01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:58.189
-- The thing is that when we start using story, the way I've been hearing it,

1239
01:08:58.569 --> 01:09:01.630
-- that almost things it sounds to me now,

1240
01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:04.840
-- we're going to reduce almost every experience they have to like,

1241
01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.990
-- you're telling a story.

1242
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.100
-- So once things get reduced, I'm like, I'm done now

1243
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:16.090
-- because that's an intellectual, like, model and sorry, I'm a human organism,

1244
01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:19.189
-- I'm not, sorry,

1245
01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:20.590
-- sorry, not, sorry,

1246
01:09:20.970 --> 01:09:23.399
-- well, whatever. But so I think,

1247
01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:24.600
-- yeah,

1248
01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:29.790
-- if it gets, if the word gets to be everything is a story,

1249
01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:31.330
-- then after a while

1250
01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:33.000
-- we're not,

1251
01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.180
-- you know what I mean? We're going to lose

1252
01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:38.399
-- what it is we're talking about, which actually needs,

1253
01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:43.500
-- depending on the tasks, certain distinctions to be made.

1254
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:52.100
-- Bill, I actually think you just got to something which was,

1255
01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:54.690
-- I was about to say that the,

1256
01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:57.180
-- if I'm hearing you right,

1257
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:59.190
the

1258
01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:03.280
-- the negative association um

1259
01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.470
-- that you have with stories is

1260
01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.980
-- kind of there.

1261
01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.290
-- You want them.

1262
01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:15.860
-- Well I won't try and characterize what you're saying.

1263
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:19.290
-- I'll just say what I was going to say, which is that the

1264
01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:26.030
-- people write stories about barry's and tigers and legends and you know,

1265
01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:29.060
-- all kinds of mythology could be built around berries and tigers.

1266
01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:33.470
-- We're gonna be talking about berries and tigers for a long time. Um, but

1267
01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:37.480
-- the december, dis ambiguous waited

1268
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.570
-- information there that led them to tell the story

1269
01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.190
-- um, is

1270
01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:48.080
-- is what you want to get past. Like

1271
01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:51.370
-- not that stories are bad, but sometimes

1272
01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:58.560
-- you don't want to hear somebody else's story, you want to filter out the stories,

1273
01:10:58.570 --> 01:11:00.970
-- but just know that stories were

1274
01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.970
-- told about this thing,

1275
01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:05.260
-- that information was attached to it that you

1276
01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.630
-- may want to associate in different ways.

1277
01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:15.780
-- So like I want the benefit of the fact that this thing that somebody told a story about

1278
01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:18.190
-- has these attributes,

1279
01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.590
-- that it's in this place, that it's

1280
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:24.370
-- that this snake is in this yard in this

1281
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:25.580
city

1282
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.430
-- and that's somebody else

1283
01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.800
-- told a different story that happened to have another

1284
01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.400
-- stake in this yard and before you know it,

1285
01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:35.470
-- hey, I realized that

1286
01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.290
-- these snakes are,

1287
01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:38.190
-- you know

1288
01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.470
-- indigenous to this area

1289
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.640
-- and you know,

1290
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:44.190
-- and the fact that,

1291
01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:46.680
-- that somebody, you know that this,

1292
01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:50.580
-- this question and answered that you have on facebook,

1293
01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.370
-- which is um,

1294
01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.980
-- not the result of search,

1295
01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:59.690
-- not the result of true storytelling

1296
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:04.250
-- that we want to preserve that decision

1297
01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.570
-- ambiguous lated information

1298
01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:10.150
-- and let that be a part of other

1299
01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:13.490
-- people's research and other people's knowledge right now.

1300
01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:14.480
-- It's siloed

1301
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:20.800
-- only on facebook perhaps, you know, privately only on somebody's or you know,

1302
01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.920
-- some friend groups.

1303
01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:23.870
-- Um,

1304
01:12:25.150 --> 01:12:31.840
-- uh, you know, page that, you know, a dozen people have access to where they're not,

1305
01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.630
-- they might be private about the banter,

1306
01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:36.480
-- but they're not private about the fact that there's a snake

1307
01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:43.080
-- in a photograph with this, you know, time and and location metadata.

1308
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:45.260
-- If it was anonymous organized.

1309
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:46.260
-- Um,

1310
01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:46.920
-- yeah,

1311
01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:50.170
-- I just want to say one more thing before because you said something super critical.

1312
01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:53.760
-- You use the word,

1313
01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:56.160
-- um, you have a

1314
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:59.390
-- either true storytelling or something.

1315
01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:03.200
-- You called something, you had an adjective on storytelling that was different.

1316
01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.370
-- I don't have a negative

1317
01:13:05.850 --> 01:13:07.710
-- association with the word story.

1318
01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:12.660
-- I'm just responding to how it seems to be being used as we have this conversation.

1319
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:15.770
-- Oh yes, yes. But something

1320
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:20.490
-- so if there's something called true storytelling,

1321
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:22.870
-- then we better find out what that is

1322
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:28.480
-- before we start using the word story for all these about many other things.

1323
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:29.150
-- Yeah.

1324
01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:31.480
-- But I just think this is a longer,

1325
01:13:32.150 --> 01:13:34.720
-- more interesting conversation

1326
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:35.380
and

1327
01:13:36.650 --> 01:13:38.380
-- I really do have to run and

1328
01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:40.530
-- squeeze the dog. Yes.

1329
01:13:40.530 --> 01:13:44.480
-- I'd like to say he actually does the squeezing, but you know what,

1330
01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:48.980
-- so I'm going to leave you all here and maybe I'll catch up on the video

1331
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:52.080
-- take and I can use the little

1332
01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:55.570
-- you can get the chat thing out of the video, can't we?

1333
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:57.470
-- We have tools for that.

1334
01:13:57.850 --> 01:13:58.170
-- Okay.

1335
01:13:59.450 --> 01:14:00.690
-- Nobody else, everybody have a good

1336
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:01.960
-- week. We'll see you bill

1337
01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.860
-- with that.

1338
01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.060
-- Yes.

1339
01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:14.870
-- Mhm.

1340
01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.450
-- Yeah, I really like what you had to say, Michael.

1341
01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.760
-- Um I put a couple of things in the chat as you were talking,

1342
01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.560
-- trying to capture a little bit of what you're saying and maybe add a little,

1343
01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:28.170
-- a little extra to um

1344
01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.730
-- yeah, and I kind of agree with Bill.

1345
01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:36.270
-- It's it's I'm not sure we need to continue to use the word story all the time,

1346
01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:40.050
-- but it is an interesting exercise to think about it.

1347
01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.670
-- And I do think there's a line between

1348
01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.160
when

1349
01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:45.960
-- we when we

1350
01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.170
-- seek out stories

1351
01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.660
-- either from each other

1352
01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.260
-- in person or whether it's,

1353
01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:55.370
-- you know, through technical means,

1354
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.460
um

1355
01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.000
-- in the traditional sense versus what our understanding

1356
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.560
-- might be of how we work unconsciously,

1357
01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.760
-- and when we get into that, I think,

1358
01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:07.490
-- um there's a value there to just

1359
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.760
-- understanding that that thread runs through everything.

1360
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:11.860
-- But I think when we start talking about what features

1361
01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:15.370
-- or what attributes or what characteristics do we want,

1362
01:15:15.370 --> 01:15:15.870
certain

1363
01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:18.660
-- interactions and connections to have.

1364
01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.840
-- I think story needs to be kind of put back

1365
01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.060
-- in where and two more of the traditional sense.

1366
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:26.690
-- Um you know, if I'm if I'm creating a workshop,

1367
01:15:26.690 --> 01:15:28.900
-- there are times when I'm creating it and I have a

1368
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:31.360
-- very clear direction of where I want everyone to go and I

1369
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.330
-- know exactly how to get them there and I'm going to walk

1370
01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:37.260
-- them through that and get them where they need to go,

1371
01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:38.760
-- there's less story

1372
01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:43.160
-- there, but if I'm looking for everyone to explore

1373
01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.990
-- and we're all trying to figure out what's going on,

1374
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.520
-- um then I'm going to be looking for stories, I want to pull stories out.

1375
01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:51.370
-- So I think

1376
01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.460
-- you know, I think um

1377
01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:57.060
-- I think we

1378
01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:00.810
-- I just go back to using the word to the traditional version is also fine,

1379
01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:05.450
-- but it's also helped us today to explore the different ways in which

1380
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:08.770
-- humans interact with each other and potentially could

1381
01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:11.050
-- interact with technology and that's been really valuable.

1382
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:25.060
-- Uh You want to say something,

1383
01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:30.750
-- I was just looking at the definition of story.

1384
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.550
Ah

1385
01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:34.110
-- I think it's funny how there's so many definitions,

1386
01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:36.120
-- that's why one of the questions I have about the

1387
01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.880
-- english language is it's just a little bit finicky.

1388
01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:39.460
Um

1389
01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:40.850
-- and uh

1390
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:44.750
-- you know I just think of story is like metadata

1391
01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:47.750
-- um I guess I

1392
01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:51.200
-- been so much in the back end of this stuff and thinking about it

1393
01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.060
-- from a very technical

1394
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:55.240
-- perspective. So

1395
01:16:55.730 --> 01:16:58.340
-- I just think of like information about information

1396
01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:03.250
-- and just think of like overlap like Kalanick overlap for shared meeting

1397
01:17:03.730 --> 01:17:04.560
-- context.

1398
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:07.410
-- But this is very interesting to me this is the kind of

1399
01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:10.750
-- stuff that I've been exploring at great length for quite some time

1400
01:17:11.130 --> 01:17:12.030
-- again,

1401
01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:16.140
-- how it relates to the back end for these different technologies using distributed

1402
01:17:16.530 --> 01:17:20.480
-- web architecture and various frameworks for helping

1403
01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.620
-- these different tools connect and inter operate.

1404
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:23.460
-- So that's like

1405
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:26.690
-- this is the main thing I'm kind of diving into, I'd say right now,

1406
01:17:26.690 --> 01:17:29.100
-- so this is cool that we're having this conversation.

1407
01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:31.350
-- I'm grateful to be a part of this. Um

1408
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:33.560
-- you know, one thing that did come to mind

1409
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:35.280
-- for me was so

1410
01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:36.560
-- when I was learning about

1411
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:42.340
-- history and I got into different religions and archaeology and things like that,

1412
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:43.850
-- the word myth,

1413
01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:48.640
-- we intuitively a lot of us at least me and the people I grew up with

1414
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:53.060
-- myth was like made up, it was false or it was kind of

1415
01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:58.060
-- elaborated or fabricated to some kind of context. But when you look at

1416
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:59.450
-- the original

1417
01:17:59.830 --> 01:18:01.150
-- epistemology of it,

1418
01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.030
-- it just means story.

1419
01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:07.800
-- And so that's what that's what kind of came to mind all this is just the mythos.

1420
01:18:07.810 --> 01:18:11.400
-- And um I think that that is an inherently probably

1421
01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:14.620
-- going to have a different meaning to each individual,

1422
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:18.440
-- you know what their individual mythos is along with their perspective

1423
01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:20.550
-- and you know, their community.

1424
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:24.250
-- So this idea of perspective is quite interesting to me because

1425
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:26.930
-- having gone down the physics rabbit hole

1426
01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.940
-- and stuff like that. It's like

1427
01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.100
-- You know you said they've done different these like

1428
01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:34.530
-- supposedly they've done these different stories like they have

1429
01:18:34.530 --> 01:18:39.540
-- the brain games and all that and uh you know you're gonna have 20 people see an event

1430
01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.070
-- and you're getting 20 different accounts

1431
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:43.140
-- of that event

1432
01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:43.940
and

1433
01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:48.130
-- couple days go by and now all of a sudden the details have changed.

1434
01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:52.650
-- So I mean that kind of is a little more on the abstract

1435
01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.540
-- theory side of things of like what is reality.

1436
01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:56.880
-- But um you know,

1437
01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:00.040
-- I just want to share like those were the things that kind of came to mind

1438
01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:01.540
-- when you were speaking.

1439
01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:03.940
-- Think sick,

1440
01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:12.330
-- I love I love that you just went to like mythos and that perspective and physics,

1441
01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:16.140
-- I mean for me that's I've gone to all those places too

1442
01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:21.850
-- and it's fascinating how that kind of all land in the in similar spots, right? That

1443
01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:24.450
-- we shape our perspective,

1444
01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:27.210
-- our perspective is shaped by our past and

1445
01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:30.010
-- our habits and everything that's around us.

1446
01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:34.930
-- And so the challenge I think for that I have tried to play with

1447
01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:39.420
-- in creating something useful and imagining

1448
01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:42.000
-- something useful made out of technology

1449
01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:47.510
-- is how do we allow for all those possibilities in one interface,

1450
01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.870
-- which drives me crazy.

1451
01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:55.430
-- And at the same time that's why to me the network view of things work so well because

1452
01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:59.640
-- I can make it what I want it to be and it can be that three layered

1453
01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:02.530
-- or three d layered, multi layered

1454
01:20:03.210 --> 01:20:03.580
-- thanks.

1455
01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:06.210
-- So I can make the associations that make sense to me,

1456
01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:10.320
-- where it gets dicey is where you know, sometimes this group is I think it's been here.

1457
01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:12.290
-- I talked before about okay,

1458
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:16.570
-- there's my version of things because this is my beliefs or these are this is my

1459
01:20:16.570 --> 01:20:21.010
-- background or this is my perspective on how I'd like to connect to this information.

1460
01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:24.200
-- And then there's a big gray area like I'm like okay I draw a

1461
01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:29.320
-- circle around myself and then there's like this big huge swath of gray area.

1462
01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:30.220
-- That is

1463
01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:33.460
-- what I think is opposed to what you think.

1464
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:37.310
-- What I think is a variation on what you think, What I think is, you know,

1465
01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.620
-- it comes at it from a different angle or whatever.

1466
01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:44.110
-- Right? And that's a huge grey areas. How do we play together in that space?

1467
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:45.440
-- In a way that makes sense.

1468
01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.970
-- And isn't so complicated that nobody wants to be there ever.

1469
01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:50.820
-- And then there's the stuff on the outside of that.

1470
01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:51.520
-- Yeah,

1471
01:20:51.610 --> 01:20:54.480
-- we pretty much all agree that this is either fact or truth

1472
01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:57.700
-- or information that everybody the berries are still there a year later.

1473
01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:02.290
-- Like it's still, you know, the berries and they're there and that's it. Right?

1474
01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:07.410
-- So the gray area is the interesting part and the hardest part to me.

1475
01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:10.540
-- Um and how and that's the collaborative part

1476
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:15.030
-- and allowing for each of us to navigate our way through that gray area in a way that

1477
01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:18.110
-- provides meaning to me and my individual life or

1478
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:20.440
-- in the life of my family or my community

1479
01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:21.730
is

1480
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:26.330
-- I think designing something that's flexible enough that doesn't have,

1481
01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:32.870
-- that allows for those different perspectives I guess and doesn't, you know,

1482
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:36.760
-- and here's where we start to get into the realm of like where biases are and where,

1483
01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:37.950
-- how do we visualize?

1484
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:41.970
-- How do we help people by visualizing those differences In my mind?

1485
01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:45.040
-- I started to do crowd sourcing things. I started to do,

1486
01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:48.330
-- you know, going, hey, if there was a piece of information, we could all,

1487
01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:52.440
-- even even here's the basin title of something and here all the parts underneath,

1488
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:56.660
-- could we all start to collaborate on? Yeah.

1489
01:21:56.670 --> 01:21:59.800
-- Most of us think that this is a great definition and most of us think that this is

1490
01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:03.200
-- a great resource and most of us think this is the best book and most of us,

1491
01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:03.450
-- right?

1492
01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:07.290
-- And yet still allow for the fringe things to be there.

1493
01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:11.230
-- It's to me that's where I'm playing right now is trying to

1494
01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:17.010
-- Yeah. And I knew that I could, if I couldn't even get like baseline me

1495
01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.910
-- collective knowledge that we all kind of agree upon.

1496
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:24.420
-- If I can't even get that, then the gray area is like, you know, we're never then

1497
01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:27.730
-- we can't even, we can't even start talking about the gray area

1498
01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.420
-- zika ahead.

1499
01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:39.210
-- Don't wait for me because um I've gotten plenty of

1500
01:22:39.210 --> 01:22:40.920
-- air time and you're just getting to speak

1501
01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.020
-- up.

1502
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:44.420
-- Okay thanks. I just wanted to address

1503
01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.270
-- back to that real quick.

1504
01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:49.620
-- Well the dream that had come to me it was actually

1505
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:50.420
um

1506
01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.630
-- you can have multiple us

1507
01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:55.920
-- but it's a shared back end, it's the shared distributed database.

1508
01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:01.020
-- Um and really customizable you eyes. So like

1509
01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:05.260
-- what where we're getting at is with these new types of technologies.

1510
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:10.910
-- You can you can you can kind of like move the pieces around as it makes sense to you

1511
01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:16.150
-- initially of course until ai gets a little more advanced or at least integrated

1512
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.460
-- into this. Uh you know it could be a template.

1513
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:23.590
-- So you can put the thing in the upper right hand corner, upper left, lower left,

1514
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.950
-- lower right.

1515
01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:26.710
-- And those are options but you can still move it amongst those four pieces.

1516
01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:29.450
-- So because the way the different brains are wired,

1517
01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:33.220
-- the way culturally there's a lot of reasons that people are going

1518
01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:37.420
-- to interact with things differently might even change according to mood.

1519
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.680
-- So some of the people I know are playing around

1520
01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:43.870
-- with kind of like a bio field sensing technology.

1521
01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:45.350
-- Um and those kinds of things.

1522
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:47.720
-- So that's kind of cool to think about how that might influence

1523
01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:49.620
-- um these different dynamics.

1524
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.230
-- So I I envision really share a database and share back ends

1525
01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:58.330
-- And but then it can be multiple different forms of presentation.

1526
01:23:58.330 --> 01:24:00.850
-- But at least you've now bridged those silos between.

1527
01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:05.010
-- You don't have to have 25 apps, you can have one app. It's almost like

1528
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:07.810
-- downloading an os client I guess right?

1529
01:24:08.190 --> 01:24:08.600
Yeah

1530
01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:11.810
-- it's cool stuff to think about how this might

1531
01:24:12.190 --> 01:24:12.650
-- you know

1532
01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:13.920
-- come about

1533
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:15.120
and

1534
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:20.020
-- and uh and then the other really important thing that I think

1535
01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:23.370
-- this is my opinion is this idea of being

1536
01:24:23.370 --> 01:24:27.420
-- resistant to civil attacks meaning multiple fake accounts.

1537
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:30.100
-- I think that's a huge problem right now of accountability

1538
01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:32.400
-- is the fact that people can go and just say a

1539
01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.680
-- bunch of stuff or act a certain way and they

1540
01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:37.450
-- can do so kind of behind this scene of anonymity.

1541
01:24:37.450 --> 01:24:39.320
-- But as soon as you bring more of these

1542
01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:42.920
-- things to light people are much more highly incentivized

1543
01:24:43.090 --> 01:24:47.880
-- to be careful and scrutinize their behavior and the information that they share.

1544
01:24:47.890 --> 01:24:54.310
-- So I think having um ways in which you can have verifiably unique accounts,

1545
01:24:54.690 --> 01:24:57.110
-- you know you don't necessarily have to share

1546
01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:00.360
-- all the information about the underlying account.

1547
01:25:00.370 --> 01:25:04.960
-- You can you don't necessarily know who they are. You don't have to know who they are.

1548
01:25:04.970 --> 01:25:08.120
-- You can if you want that in the rules of your network but

1549
01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:11.440
-- you at least know that they're verifiably unique

1550
01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:14.770
-- like that that accounts actions has meaning.

1551
01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:16.210
-- So if you can imagine,

1552
01:25:16.690 --> 01:25:19.520
-- you know your reputation or behavior what do you want to call it?

1553
01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:22.620
-- An Uber affects the grocery store affects the restaurant.

1554
01:25:22.630 --> 01:25:25.470
-- And then now you could filter reviews that you want

1555
01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:28.060
-- to read based on those scores and you know,

1556
01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:30.700
-- it's more customizable if you want to go and search

1557
01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:36.110
-- um for things, you can basically decide what's important to you.

1558
01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:39.970
-- What metrics of measurement you no matter in

1559
01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:41.920
-- the information that you want to access.

1560
01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:43.310
-- I hope that's a

1561
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:45.110
-- good way to describe it.

1562
01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:52.180
-- Yeah.

1563
01:25:52.190 --> 01:25:55.290
-- And I want it and you know,

1564
01:25:55.290 --> 01:26:01.270
-- thinking about how um I mean we we we talk about this in various groups of us.

1565
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:02.590
-- Just that that

1566
01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:03.580
-- yeah.

1567
01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:06.990
-- You know wanting the shared um

1568
01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:11.490
-- the shared library of of

1569
01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.000
um

1570
01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:17.240
-- data and all the different ways of looking at it.

1571
01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:20.610
-- Whether it's in a wiki and a map and you

1572
01:26:20.610 --> 01:26:25.630
-- know by association with people by association with topics by,

1573
01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:31.500
-- you know, um you know, just being able to filter um in

1574
01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:41.400
-- in different front ends and within different front ends in different ways. Um

1575
01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:46.500
-- Yeah, that's the kind of interoperability I think. You know, we're

1576
01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:48.500
-- all striving for.

1577
01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:49.810
Um

1578
01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:52.210
-- so you're gonna build the back end for us.

1579
01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:52.990
-- Mhm.

1580
01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:55.500
-- You got, you got that, you got that part knocked.

1581
01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.210
-- I'm working on it right now as we speak.

1582
01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:01.900
-- Okay, let's talk. Um

1583
01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:06.800
-- I just also wanted to say something about the um

1584
01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.100
-- mythmaking um

1585
01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:14.890
-- the myth,

1586
01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:19.200
-- I'll go back to container um for

1587
01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:24.100
-- um for certain sets of facts that you know individually

1588
01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:29.490
-- as when Wendy as you were saying. You know, you come up with your own beliefs that,

1589
01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:30.710
-- and,

1590
01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:35.700
-- and as groups, we do as religions. We do, you know, that

1591
01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:40.100
-- son, you know, rises in east and sets in the west and the

1592
01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:44.310
-- myth that's built around that of the, you know,

1593
01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:48.400
-- um, you know, pick your, you know, uh,

1594
01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:49.090
-- okay,

1595
01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:58.000
-- aboriginal, you know, story of the wolf swallowing the sun and uh, you know, um,

1596
01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:00.400
that

1597
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:08.290
-- we do that and you know, in modern day, we also do that in a way where like, oh, these,

1598
01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:09.290
-- these facts

1599
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:13.000
-- don't fit with the mythology. I already,

1600
01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:17.000
-- you know, constructed and therefore I'm not going to include them.

1601
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:19.790
-- Um, but if if

1602
01:28:21.170 --> 01:28:25.280
-- everybody has access to all the,

1603
01:28:27.570 --> 01:28:28.290
-- um,

1604
01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:33.900
-- you know, I have the problem of, do you call them facts, even all the, all the,

1605
01:28:34.770 --> 01:28:35.600
-- the,

1606
01:28:37.670 --> 01:28:41.990
-- the possible data points within somebody's story

1607
01:28:42.670 --> 01:28:43.410
-- are,

1608
01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:45.900
-- and the metadata attached to them

1609
01:28:46.770 --> 01:28:50.790
-- is all accessible to anybody who is

1610
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:56.600
-- looking at their own story, constructing a story, knowing what pieces of the story.

1611
01:28:56.610 --> 01:28:57.400
-- Um,

1612
01:29:00.170 --> 01:29:01.600
-- in no

1613
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.190
-- are questionable.

1614
01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:06.930
-- I mean, if you want to lead anybody, you know, we always have this problem of like,

1615
01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:07.890
-- can you really,

1616
01:29:08.670 --> 01:29:12.140
-- can you really change somebody's mind by attacking their story?

1617
01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:14.910
-- Um, you know, they're gonna want to defend their story,

1618
01:29:14.910 --> 01:29:18.690
-- but if anybody on their own can see

1619
01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:21.180
-- what parts of their story

1620
01:29:21.570 --> 01:29:22.610
have

1621
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:24.900
-- different stories attached to them

1622
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.780
that

1623
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:27.100
-- don't,

1624
01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:30.500
-- don't negate

1625
01:29:30.970 --> 01:29:35.500
-- the fact that this piece of their story exists, but provide

1626
01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:36.690
other

1627
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:40.380
-- related explanations that might be able to bend their thinking

1628
01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:43.100
-- a little bit or at least open themselves up to.

1629
01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:46.880
-- Maybe this thing can be seen a different way.

1630
01:29:46.890 --> 01:29:47.240
-- You know,

1631
01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:50.070
-- maybe there's a scientific explanation for the sun coming

1632
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:52.100
-- up in the east and setting in the west.

1633
01:29:52.670 --> 01:29:54.890
-- I mean it's

1634
01:29:56.370 --> 01:29:59.410
-- yeah, I don't know where I'm going with this, but I just like,

1635
01:29:59.410 --> 01:30:05.690
-- you know the story as container I come back to and the and like let's let

1636
01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:07.080
um

1637
01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:11.290
-- data points that don't have stories around them exist.

1638
01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:14.870
-- I guess I guess part of what I'm, what I'm trying to say is like

1639
01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:18.790
-- trying to think of a framework in which

1640
01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:21.980
-- it's okay to for a fact to be

1641
01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:26.010
-- the data points to be part of the story. It's okay for it not to be part of the story.

1642
01:30:26.010 --> 01:30:29.030
-- It's okay for it to be part of multiple stories

1643
01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.870
-- and we all get visibility on all of that.

1644
01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:38.970
-- Um if if we want it and we can also filter out like, you know,

1645
01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:41.070
-- I'm just interested in recipes for these berries.

1646
01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:45.730
-- I don't care about the myths and the tigers and the location where they can.

1647
01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.410
-- I don't I don't want any of that.

1648
01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:51.180
-- Please just show me recipes and you don't see all that stuff.

1649
01:30:59.460 --> 01:30:59.790
Mhm

1650
01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:06.290
-- Yeah, I think you said it all. I can't remember what I was going to say now.

1651
01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:11.070
-- Yeah, I think one of the things I was I was going to stay somewhere in there is,

1652
01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:14.440
-- you know, there's the myth of the hero's journey, right?

1653
01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.770
-- And and with which is joseph Campbell nod your head

1654
01:31:17.770 --> 01:31:20.040
-- if you know of joseph Campbell and all this.

1655
01:31:20.050 --> 01:31:21.740
-- Okay, so everybody's feeling okay,

1656
01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:28.580
-- So when you start looking at how often the humans retail that story

1657
01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:29.580
-- and it's

1658
01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:34.910
-- million, literally millions of versions of this story, you know?

1659
01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:37.380
-- And here joseph Campbell tried to break it down and

1660
01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:39.520
-- put it into parts and give us give us a

1661
01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.890
-- schema from which to follow along if we want to

1662
01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:46.290
-- build this story or understand it better and it's really,

1663
01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:47.390
-- really useful.

1664
01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:48.690
-- And then to Michael's point, Yeah,

1665
01:31:48.690 --> 01:31:50.680
-- but sometimes I just need some berries and do we need

1666
01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:53.780
-- to go through a whole hero's journey to find the berries?

1667
01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:54.790
-- No.

1668
01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.160
-- Right, so, again,

1669
01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:00.480
-- I think there's there's an opportunity if we're if we're in trauma,

1670
01:32:00.490 --> 01:32:01.980
-- we need to tell stories.

1671
01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:08.960
-- If we're in therapy, we need space held for stories. And how do we come?

1672
01:32:08.970 --> 01:32:10.120
-- Oh yeah, this is the other thing.

1673
01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:14.660
-- So when you have two people who conflict on their version of truth

1674
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:17.580
-- and it seems diametrically opposed,

1675
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:21.160
-- pretty much everybody agrees that the way to get through that is to find connection.

1676
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:27.880
-- Right? So what if we had a platform that helped us to build connection? Right?

1677
01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:32.810
-- So it's the same database. It's the same data. It it's we are now.

1678
01:32:32.810 --> 01:32:36.600
-- But the visual then shows these two things are currently opposed?

1679
01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:40.180
-- And now here is a little intersection and people start working on well,

1680
01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:42.220
-- where is the intersection between those two things?

1681
01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:46.440
-- Right here, right here. In between the in between space. Right.

1682
01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.430
-- And so even if these two sections

1683
01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.910
-- seemingly get more and more diametrically opposed,

1684
01:32:50.910 --> 01:32:53.570
-- it turns out that everyone likes puppies, right?

1685
01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:58.270
-- Or whatever. You know, it's it's and I think that that's where

1686
01:32:58.650 --> 01:32:59.370
um

1687
01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:03.930
-- massive wiki is helping. Right? Like any time we're building connections.

1688
01:33:03.930 --> 01:33:09.190
-- It's a very human thing that brings us that's how we're wired. Right?

1689
01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:12.210
-- It brings us we don't always need a story or we need

1690
01:33:12.210 --> 01:33:15.030
-- we don't always need to know that we're building a story.

1691
01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:18.380
-- Even if we are we need to build connections to me.

1692
01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:21.100
-- That's the key stories do that really,

1693
01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:23.810
-- really well because they elicit emotion and emotional.

1694
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:24.780
-- It's it's connection.

1695
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:27.820
-- But I mean the connection to be built in and

1696
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:32.350
-- Myriads of ways and and it breaks down barriers?

1697
01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:35.750
-- It breaks down silos between people between information between.

1698
01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:39.270
-- It's about So to me it's about the connections in the end.

1699
01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:46.910
-- Yeah.

1700
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:48.590
-- And then and then back to what you were saying,

1701
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:52.170
-- Zeke one database helps to build connections faster

1702
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:56.880
-- by its very nature. And my my estimation. Right, because you're not

1703
01:33:57.250 --> 01:33:58.620
-- now we're not all slowed down.

1704
01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:00.400
-- The whole system doesn't slow down and go, OK,

1705
01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:03.030
-- But this connect this system doesn't talk to that system.

1706
01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:07.420
-- Okay, well two years of development and a million headaches later.

1707
01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:10.560
-- Now we can finally send two pieces of information across to each other. Right?

1708
01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:13.960
-- It's not the point is right to to facilitate all of that.

1709
01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:18.140
-- Um Yes how do we do that?

1710
01:34:18.150 --> 01:34:22.760
-- We need that yesterday I'm sure that every single

1711
01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:26.050
-- developer in the entire history of the internet has

1712
01:34:26.050 --> 01:34:28.850
-- been saying how do we how do we get

1713
01:34:28.850 --> 01:34:31.680
-- these two pieces of information on the same database?

1714
01:34:31.690 --> 01:34:36.060
-- Are you familiar with self hosting? Cloud hosting?

1715
01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:38.880
-- Yeah.

1716
01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:41.010
-- Just from a user perspective,

1717
01:34:41.010 --> 01:34:42.510
-- not from a tackle technical

1718
01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.640
-- right now our information

1719
01:34:44.650 --> 01:34:47.460
-- you send a text to your family and friends

1720
01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:51.050
-- And that's now seen in 10,000 databases across the world.

1721
01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:56.610
-- Um So those are centralized servers giant big warehouse buildings

1722
01:34:56.610 --> 01:34:59.450
-- but just stacks and stacks of servers and an I.

1723
01:34:59.450 --> 01:35:00.860
-- T. Team and all that stuff

1724
01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:01.960
-- taking that

1725
01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:04.460
-- and giving a slice to the individual

1726
01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:06.360
-- allowing them to plug in

1727
01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:10.360
-- device that uses the same amount of electricity as your hard

1728
01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:14.660
-- drive would on full capacity or whatever so much less than mining

1729
01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:16.450
-- crypto or anything like that.

1730
01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:20.560
-- But then you're sharing different instances of these applications

1731
01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:21.770
across

1732
01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:24.230
-- a large range of notes.

1733
01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:28.260
-- Now you have a distributed database. I believe that that's

1734
01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.670
-- one possible solution potentially where

1735
01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:32.800
-- you know

1736
01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:34.860
-- there's there's always going to be

1737
01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:37.460
-- frankly divided.

1738
01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:41.820
-- I want to sit in silos but they don't necessarily have to function so much like silos.

1739
01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:46.670
-- It's more I think of them as like permission membranes permission servers. Right.

1740
01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:52.110
-- Um But still like it's so cool because the way that they can access the data,

1741
01:35:52.110 --> 01:35:56.290
-- it doesn't require global consensus, but you can still find,

1742
01:35:56.290 --> 01:35:59.690
-- you can still very readily identify where,

1743
01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:02.190
-- where there's that overlap kind of how you were talking about.

1744
01:36:02.190 --> 01:36:05.060
-- There is the core and then there's the periphery gray area but

1745
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:08.560
-- should in theory I would think allow us to identify

1746
01:36:08.730 --> 01:36:13.460
-- where we have the most overlap in our in our data, in our shared data. Right?

1747
01:36:22.330 --> 01:36:24.150
-- I'm really uh

1748
01:36:25.230 --> 01:36:26.060
um

1749
01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:27.950
-- I really like

1750
01:36:28.730 --> 01:36:29.650
-- permission ng

1751
01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:31.060
um

1752
01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:34.850
-- decentralization and commissioning,

1753
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:37.460
-- you know, coming up out of that.

1754
01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:41.950
-- I'm not sure I followed everything that you were saying but the idea that

1755
01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:44.050
um

1756
01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:53.250
-- well the holy Grail that um we all have

1757
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:56.350
-- all of our own information

1758
01:36:56.730 --> 01:37:01.340
-- on our own hard drives and the ability

1759
01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:02.250
to

1760
01:37:03.330 --> 01:37:05.550
-- permission it outwards in

1761
01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:07.340
-- myriad ways

1762
01:37:07.730 --> 01:37:08.450
um

1763
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:13.880
-- saying like I want this specific piece of information

1764
01:37:13.890 --> 01:37:17.430
-- to be shared with this one person too.

1765
01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.740
-- I want this

1766
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:22.060
-- data I've Gary gathered about

1767
01:37:23.130 --> 01:37:26.640
-- you know, berries in this location to be

1768
01:37:27.230 --> 01:37:28.250
shared

1769
01:37:28.730 --> 01:37:29.960
globally

1770
01:37:30.330 --> 01:37:31.850
-- but without

1771
01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:35.060
-- specific attribution to me

1772
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:39.930
-- except as somebody who was a first degree

1773
01:37:39.930 --> 01:37:42.750
-- witness to the berries existing in that place

1774
01:37:43.330 --> 01:37:44.740
-- as a for instance

1775
01:37:45.130 --> 01:37:46.240
-- that just

1776
01:37:47.130 --> 01:37:47.750
um

1777
01:37:48.730 --> 01:37:51.640
-- you know that that control of permission ng

1778
01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:53.450
and

1779
01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:57.360
-- permission ng as container

1780
01:37:57.370 --> 01:38:00.400
-- what the internet was supposed to be. She mentioned

1781
01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:03.270
-- previously and his original dream what his original

1782
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:05.150
-- vision of the internet was supposed to be

1783
01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:08.650
-- so we can sell host our applications. So

1784
01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:11.900
-- you know, we're we're hosting, we're hosting our own data.

1785
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:16.640
-- It's not going through, it's no longer going through that centralized database.

1786
01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:20.900
-- Um so that allows for um I mean there's tons of challenges,

1787
01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:24.030
-- of course obstacles that come with that, especially for security.

1788
01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:28.280
-- Um but you know, it should be much quicker.

1789
01:38:28.290 --> 01:38:30.260
-- In theory, things could be a lot more lightweight,

1790
01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:31.880
-- You wouldn't need as many lines of code,

1791
01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:34.250
-- you wouldn't need as many calls and things like that.

1792
01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:38.030
-- Um so and also should open up the door for

1793
01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:42.640
-- um just the ability to see the different perspectives. So you can kind of like,

1794
01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:46.440
-- you know, get a better idea of more of a compilation of

1795
01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:50.960
-- what this serve over here is seeing or doing and so on.

1796
01:38:50.970 --> 01:38:55.320
-- So you get a variety of the different perspectives as to what's going on.

1797
01:38:55.330 --> 01:38:57.440
-- And then ultimately, you know, once,

1798
01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:00.540
-- once artificial super intelligence arrives

1799
01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:01.750
sometimes

1800
01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:05.150
-- whenever that is, um

1801
01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:08.750
-- now you're talking about literally like a cloud, you know,

1802
01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:10.940
-- like the robot Sophia's brain, like

1803
01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:13.340
-- it's just the cloud is like in her brain,

1804
01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:14.740
-- whatever it is, you know,

1805
01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:18.030
-- um that part is scary. Maybe what

1806
01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:20.150
-- um just if you look at

1807
01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:23.490
-- the idea of an intentional intelligence.

1808
01:39:23.490 --> 01:39:27.380
-- Programmable intelligence is the ability of what it can allow us to

1809
01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:30.980
-- do with a lot of automated processing and handling of data.

1810
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:33.360
-- So one of the things that the reason I'm sharing is one of things

1811
01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:39.530
-- I'm very interested in is this idea of oracle's oracles is like a box,

1812
01:39:39.530 --> 01:39:41.250
-- like a black box, you put an input

1813
01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:43.350
-- and then it gives you an output. So it's like an

1814
01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:45.250
-- basically an automated function.

1815
01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:50.010
-- And so I could see these different functions being able to kind of gather data.

1816
01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:53.070
-- So it's not like a human necessarily that has to like

1817
01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:56.010
-- enter in this data and this database and organize it.

1818
01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:58.300
-- But it's it's more of a conglomeration.

1819
01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:01.400
-- I'm sure like big tech companies are already using that now.

1820
01:40:01.410 --> 01:40:03.830
-- I mean governments for sure have to be using it. But

1821
01:40:04.010 --> 01:40:06.320
-- allowing those same technologies that they have

1822
01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:12.970
-- that's you know um proprietary and giving that to the people I think

1823
01:40:12.970 --> 01:40:17.240
-- could really open up the floodgates for like for what we're talking about.

1824
01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:19.030
-- Um I don't know how that's possible but

1825
01:40:19.410 --> 01:40:20.330
-- that's just like

1826
01:40:20.710 --> 01:40:23.940
-- what that's what I'm hoping can happen at some point.

1827
01:40:29.210 --> 01:40:32.540
-- Yes. Going back to the privacy piece for a second

1828
01:40:34.710 --> 01:40:36.450
-- when I started to envision, okay,

1829
01:40:36.450 --> 01:40:39.440
-- this is my store of knowledge and I started to talk to people about

1830
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:42.530
-- privacy issues around that.

1831
01:40:43.410 --> 01:40:46.530
-- It both frightened people but also

1832
01:40:47.110 --> 01:40:51.340
-- open doors to write like if there if we really could trust that the thing I'm

1833
01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:54.050
-- creating for my secure ating knowledge for myself

1834
01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:55.950
-- can be private because I'm storing it here.

1835
01:40:55.950 --> 01:41:00.630
-- It's next to me. I only give permission to people who I give permission to access it.

1836
01:41:02.010 --> 01:41:05.410
-- Then a whole host of things becomes possible right now.

1837
01:41:05.410 --> 01:41:08.240
-- I'm not just storing knowledge like the berries. Right?

1838
01:41:08.250 --> 01:41:10.620
-- I'm stirring knowledge that is

1839
01:41:11.110 --> 01:41:14.530
-- that I am extremely aware. I want to keep private.

1840
01:41:15.110 --> 01:41:17.050
-- I'm working on something brand new.

1841
01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:20.630
-- Someone someone could take it and run with it and I'm not ready to publish it yet.

1842
01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:23.120
-- Could be one which is knowledge

1843
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:27.020
-- based. But what about medical based? What about financial base?

1844
01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:29.400
-- What about all those other ways in which right now

1845
01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.440
-- a lot of my dad is sitting somewhere else,

1846
01:41:31.450 --> 01:41:32.440
-- which, you know,

1847
01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:37.290
-- it has to sit with like a high wall around it and I barely can get access to it.

1848
01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:41.330
-- What if I owned that? And it could start making associations between

1849
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:45.210
-- the things that I already know about my own financial

1850
01:41:45.210 --> 01:41:49.680
-- or medical situation and that the other space out there

1851
01:41:49.690 --> 01:41:54.440
-- right where it is the shared knowledge base and I can dip in and out of those two and go,

1852
01:41:54.450 --> 01:41:55.310
-- oh wow,

1853
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:58.260
-- this is a diagnosis that I just received or these are

1854
01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:01.510
-- symptoms I have or this is my past history and what's,

1855
01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:06.790
-- you know, what can I learn from the, from the, the knowledge network,

1856
01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:10.500
-- from the public Knowledge Networks Fear about myself and that's interesting.

1857
01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:14.020
-- Save it down. Oh, that's interesting. Save it down. That's interesting.

1858
01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:17.100
-- Save it down, you know, and these five things over here kind of interesting to,

1859
01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:19.020
-- but let me save them for later and let me curate it

1860
01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:20.470
-- in a way that I can find it when I want it,

1861
01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:20.750
-- Right?

1862
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:22.230
-- So to me it's

1863
01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:24.120
-- opens the door to

1864
01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:25.450
-- us as humans,

1865
01:42:25.450 --> 01:42:30.140
-- re owning our own story might say our our own knowledge and being able

1866
01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:36.120
-- to use technology for that benefit of knowing ourselves better in a world that

1867
01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:37.400
-- yeah,

1868
01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:40.720
-- in our lifetimes we come across,

1869
01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:45.100
-- I don't know what the factor is of the amount of information we now

1870
01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:49.440
-- come across and have access to in comparison to just say two generations ago.

1871
01:42:49.450 --> 01:42:52.020
-- And we, but our brains can't

1872
01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:55.490
-- hold it much more than we, right?

1873
01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:59.100
-- So let's use technology to hold it and help us help facilitate that

1874
01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:04.420
-- thinking really take advantage of all that's available to us is super cool.

1875
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:07.840
-- And I don't think it's really possible unless we can lock it.

1876
01:43:07.850 --> 01:43:11.230
-- Thus, we, as individuals can trust that it's locked in a safe place.

1877
01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.120
-- I'll always be a little nervous,

1878
01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:13.690
-- right?

1879
01:43:13.690 --> 01:43:16.330
-- And I always won't want to put up the most important pieces

1880
01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:20.190
-- of my life on this thing unless I know it's really safe.

1881
01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:22.600
-- And so this is to me this is huge.

1882
01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:24.610
-- It's found it's part of the reason why I'm struggling.

1883
01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:29.730
-- I struggled for years to develop it because I kind of want to wait

1884
01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:33.230
-- for that technology to come up because I don't want to develop it twice.

1885
01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:41.820
I'm

1886
01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:46.330
-- I'm hearing what you're saying and resonating and

1887
01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:47.920
and

1888
01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:48.610
-- okay,

1889
01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:53.610
-- and also thinking about the,

1890
01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:56.620
-- you know, we want to feel secure

1891
01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:57.920
-- and yet

1892
01:43:58.300 --> 01:43:59.020
-- are,

1893
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:01.690
-- yeah,

1894
01:44:02.590 --> 01:44:04.810
-- our identities can be

1895
01:44:05.490 --> 01:44:09.710
-- um stolen and our our, you know, our finances,

1896
01:44:10.190 --> 01:44:12.830
-- our financial records can be hacked and you know,

1897
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:14.840
-- people probably don't want to get our medical records,

1898
01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:16.240
-- but certainly you know when they're in

1899
01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:19.700
-- somebody else's hands were worried about that and

1900
01:44:20.090 --> 01:44:21.310
um

1901
01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:23.410
-- that security pieces,

1902
01:44:25.190 --> 01:44:26.890
-- you know what's under our control,

1903
01:44:26.890 --> 01:44:30.200
-- we can govern but there's so much that's not under our control.

1904
01:44:30.690 --> 01:44:31.310
Um

1905
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:38.110
-- Yeah and and and to circle back to something you were saying,

1906
01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:43.110
-- Zeke actually I don't remember who was saying this, but just about the

1907
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:49.520
-- yeah I think it was easy talking about, you know, Oracles and and um

1908
01:44:51.690 --> 01:44:57.420
-- you know general intelligence when it comes to be um like

1909
01:44:57.890 --> 01:45:03.280
-- being able to just the way that we construct mythologies and stories and

1910
01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:11.620
-- and explanations and scientific theories around um facts to be able to loose

1911
01:45:12.090 --> 01:45:12.710
um

1912
01:45:13.190 --> 01:45:18.020
-- a general intelligence in oracle, you know something on a set of facts

1913
01:45:18.690 --> 01:45:21.020
-- that we don't even know what we want to make of.

1914
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.920
Um

1915
01:45:22.590 --> 01:45:25.310
-- But just to like say,

1916
01:45:25.890 --> 01:45:32.210
-- you know, maybe not be smart enough to have a point of view. Um but more say

1917
01:45:33.090 --> 01:45:36.210
-- here is a possible explanation that fits all these facts together

1918
01:45:36.690 --> 01:45:39.810
-- or these data points which may or may not be facts.

1919
01:45:40.190 --> 01:45:46.120
-- Um And and you know this one makes sense of like

1920
01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:52.250
-- 90 of the 100 facts you put in here, but these 10 would disprove it.

1921
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:58.120
-- So maybe it's worth concentrating on whether these 10 are in fact

1922
01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:00.020
-- you know accurate

1923
01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:04.160
-- um because if they're not then then this all works,

1924
01:46:04.170 --> 01:46:09.250
-- but if you know those to be true then this whole thing falls apart.

1925
01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:09.890
Um

1926
01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:17.900
-- and yeah, I mean you know general access to all of those data points

1927
01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:20.720
-- um in the same language, you know,

1928
01:46:20.730 --> 01:46:28.310
-- including the snake photos in the garden on facebook, want to get there

1929
01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:30.950
-- and the cool thing with the internet of things,

1930
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:34.500
-- we're going to have access to large amounts of data like never before.

1931
01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:37.210
-- So that hopefully will help this process

1932
01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:39.330
-- because we'll just have access to they're going

1933
01:46:39.330 --> 01:46:40.850
-- to have all these little sensors on everything.

1934
01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:43.380
-- You're just going to be uploading tons and tons of

1935
01:46:43.390 --> 01:46:45.890
-- data constantly all the time about a bunch of stuff

1936
01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:47.890
-- that's going to be really cool

1937
01:46:48.130 --> 01:46:49.990
-- and then just having it so that we can

1938
01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:55.970
-- compile that data and design algorithms in which the machine can,

1939
01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:58.360
-- you know start learning about it and trying to

1940
01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:00.950
-- piece it together and then it presents us says,

1941
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:01.700
-- hey, you know,

1942
01:47:01.710 --> 01:47:03.760
-- got all this like these are the 90 these are

1943
01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:05.730
-- the 10 and here's like some stuff and what it could

1944
01:47:05.730 --> 01:47:08.650
-- mean and these are other people that are you know doing

1945
01:47:08.650 --> 01:47:10.990
-- the same thing and reading and learning about this and so

1946
01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:14.900
-- it just can present to you and then you can say like you can even, you know,

1947
01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:17.830
-- teach it, it's like machine learning human,

1948
01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:19.880
-- human guided machine learning makes a lot of sense.

1949
01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:21.170
-- So yeah that was helpful.

1950
01:47:21.170 --> 01:47:24.380
-- No that wasn't helpful or let's put that aside for later and then in

1951
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:28.090
-- tag it if something else comes up let me know pop up a notification

1952
01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:29.710
-- stuff like that.

1953
01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:32.770
-- So it's really cool to think about the fact that like right now

1954
01:47:32.770 --> 01:47:36.990
-- we don't have yet all these sensors and all this like day to get

1955
01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:40.960
-- access to potential data but once that's available that

1956
01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:43.500
-- that that I think can open up a lot of

1957
01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:45.210
-- a lot of possibilities to

1958
01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:53.050
-- and that brings me to the fears that we all have and that you know

1959
01:47:53.050 --> 01:47:59.210
-- are are realized and true about um the monitoring of the data that we generate

1960
01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:06.330
-- By 3rd parties by you know the amazons and googles and the you know the

1961
01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:10.560
-- the the ad targeting algorithms that we feel

1962
01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:13.500
-- uncomfortable about and we want control over.

1963
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:18.460
-- Um And when you think about you know Iot stuff you

1964
01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:21.210
-- think oh my God is you know my vacuum cleaner gonna be

1965
01:48:21.210 --> 01:48:26.400
-- eavesdropping on my conversation so amazon can like you know change

1966
01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:29.780
-- the pricing on something because they know I really want it.

1967
01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:30.890
Um

1968
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:32.780
And

1969
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:38.600
-- if if we felt confident that we all individually had

1970
01:48:39.870 --> 01:48:44.810
-- you know control of that stuff on our own servers and shared it voluntarily.

1971
01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:47.190
-- Like I'm fine with sharing

1972
01:48:47.770 --> 01:48:51.120
-- you know the chemical analysis of the dust in my house

1973
01:48:51.570 --> 01:48:55.190
-- um via my vacuum cleaner with you know

1974
01:48:55.670 --> 01:48:59.090
-- academic institutions that are you know, looking at

1975
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:06.510
-- the migratory habits of different animals and can tell from, you know,

1976
01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:09.640
-- there's all kinds of stuff that you'd be cool with if you knew.

1977
01:49:09.650 --> 01:49:14.110
-- Yeah. All right, fine. I'm I'm up for that. I'm down for that. Here's my data.

1978
01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:15.500
-- You can you can have a constant

1979
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:18.920
-- monitoring of the flow of data from my vacuum cleaner.

1980
01:49:18.930 --> 01:49:24.910
-- You know, this research program. It would be a lot different than God.

1981
01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:28.100
-- Don't let anybody see anything because I don't know what they're doing with it.

1982
01:49:29.770 --> 01:49:32.870
-- That's right. Yeah. And to be really cool to know what people are doing with it.

1983
01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:37.180
-- To see how useful it's been encourages you to write to then give more

1984
01:49:37.670 --> 01:49:38.090
data

1985
01:49:38.570 --> 01:49:41.780
-- to the right people to is key. So yeah, that's cool. I agree.

1986
01:49:47.470 --> 01:49:50.680
-- If people are willing, I just want to flip this on its head for a second.

1987
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:55.980
-- So we're talking about the edges of where this could go, which is super cool.

1988
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:59.190
-- And then it's reminding me of an article I read yesterday which is

1989
01:49:59.570 --> 01:50:00.620
-- the simple,

1990
01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:04.830
-- the simplest version of this and how it could be immensely useful right now,

1991
01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:06.820
-- which is treating this article.

1992
01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:10.470
-- And I've been thinking a lot about phantom work we were talking about this last week.

1993
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:14.570
-- Right, Michael. Can't remember. Ok. So I read a really good article about,

1994
01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:19.380
-- written by it was in the atlantic. I can post it if you guys want to

1995
01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:20.380
um

1996
01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:28.380
-- I want to read it from a woman who writes often about the social, um,

1997
01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:33.380
-- the government's projects and um,

1998
01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:38.890
-- and solutions for supporting the social structure of society. Right?

1999
01:50:38.890 --> 01:50:42.370
-- So it could be like helping somebody with homelessness or helping somebody get

2000
01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:44.390
-- Money from the government who they were

2001
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:46.730
-- promised because of COVID-19 issues or whatever.

2002
01:50:46.730 --> 01:50:49.200
-- Right? Any, any of those kind of programs.

2003
01:50:49.210 --> 01:50:51.480
-- And she's saying she got to a point where she, you know,

2004
01:50:51.490 --> 01:50:52.840
-- obviously there's always red tape,

2005
01:50:52.850 --> 01:50:57.280
-- obviously there's always too many forms to fill out all the rest.

2006
01:50:57.660 --> 01:50:59.990
-- But she's got to a point where she started

2007
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:02.120
-- noticing after reporting on it for years and years.

2008
01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:05.150
-- Maybe this is about, I'm guessing now about five years ago or something.

2009
01:51:05.150 --> 01:51:06.480
-- She started to recognize that,

2010
01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:10.630
-- wow, this has gotten to a whole new level of complicated.

2011
01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:13.250
-- And does it really need to be this complicated?

2012
01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:15.090
-- There's such uh,

2013
01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:20.240
-- so much friction for people who are need help to get the help that they need,

2014
01:51:20.250 --> 01:51:23.090
-- whether it's in health care and making a million phone

2015
01:51:23.090 --> 01:51:26.090
-- calls to your insurance company when you're ill or it's,

2016
01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:27.970
-- you know, not, you know,

2017
01:51:27.970 --> 01:51:30.250
-- homelessness and making having to fill out

2018
01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:32.720
-- forms with random questions to make absolutely no

2019
01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:36.070
-- sense to anybody under any circumstances on order

2020
01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:37.920
-- to just have a meeting with somebody.

2021
01:51:37.930 --> 01:51:40.870
-- And she pointed out some very clear examples

2022
01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:42.880
-- of how this works.

2023
01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:46.810
-- And so I just think it's interesting, I think that, you know,

2024
01:51:46.810 --> 01:51:48.700
-- just having a knowledge repository,

2025
01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:51.330
-- we're not even talking about personal now when I'm talking about the gray

2026
01:51:51.330 --> 01:51:53.810
-- area and we're not even talking about the future of what's possible.

2027
01:51:53.810 --> 01:51:58.970
-- We're talking about that public knowledge store. That could be that with

2028
01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:02.920
-- the time and attention of people who have the time and attention to give could

2029
01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:07.820
-- be immensely useful to the people who don't have the time and attention to give,

2030
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:12.660
-- who either are ill or don't have the money, the resources, the time,

2031
01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:14.390
-- the energy or whatever.

2032
01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:19.070
-- And she talked about how those things used to be done by a government agency.

2033
01:52:19.250 --> 01:52:21.380
-- There's really no quality control it anymore.

2034
01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:24.980
-- So now teachers are doing that work and social workers are doing that work and other,

2035
01:52:25.150 --> 01:52:25.420
-- you know,

2036
01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:29.330
-- non profit agencies are doing the work of trying to help individuals get

2037
01:52:29.330 --> 01:52:32.390
-- to what they need and get through the system to what they need.

2038
01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:38.510
-- So it's just interesting to me um as a as a thought exercise and maybe also

2039
01:52:38.510 --> 01:52:44.580
-- as a good test case to in terms of trying to get information to the right people

2040
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:46.970
-- at the right time in the right place when they need it.

2041
01:52:47.250 --> 01:52:52.710
-- Um It's low hanging fruit in terms of solutions, solution finding, you know,

2042
01:52:52.710 --> 01:52:54.870
-- here's the solution here is how to get through it.

2043
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:56.970
-- Here's an organization. They'll help you navigate through it.

2044
01:52:57.350 --> 01:53:00.770
-- You know, at least you have the information at the at the baseline.

2045
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:03.170
-- Um Just as a thought

2046
01:53:08.350 --> 01:53:09.480
-- Thanks Peter That's the one

2047
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:23.270
-- was it you that posted it to matter most.

2048
01:53:23.850 --> 01:53:26.230
-- Did someone post to matter most. Is that how I ended up with it?

2049
01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:27.300
-- Because I can't remember.

2050
01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:31.540
-- I didn't start with it. I grabbed the link.

2051
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:33.980
-- I found the link after somebody had mentioned it.

2052
01:53:34.450 --> 01:53:35.580
-- I think maybe it was you

2053
01:53:37.650 --> 01:53:39.790
-- and, and Michael knows it too obvious.

2054
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:44.470
-- So we're coming up on two hours. This has been an awesome conversation.

2055
01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:47.870
-- Maybe it's a good time to route.

2056
01:53:50.050 --> 01:53:51.100
-- Um, I'll post

2057
01:53:51.110 --> 01:53:52.590
-- reported this one

2058
01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:53.970
-- too. Yeah. Look forward

2059
01:53:53.970 --> 01:53:55.010
-- to think

2060
01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:55.570
-- that.

2061
01:53:55.950 --> 01:54:02.060
-- Um, I'll plus the zoom chat, uh, in the channel. Yeah.

2062
01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:06.660
-- And I'll put the link to the recording there and then I'll get it on Youtube publicly.

2063
01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:10.970
-- So nice to meet you, Zeke. I'm so glad you're here today.

2064
01:54:10.980 --> 01:54:12.090
-- Nice to meet you.

2065
01:54:12.190 --> 01:54:15.370
-- I really appreciate this conversation. So it's amazing.

2066
01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:18.450
-- Thank you all for doing what you're doing and being you.

2067
01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:23.730
-- Yeah. You too. I think we'd all agree.

2068
01:54:23.730 --> 01:54:25.380
-- And I think I probably speak for everyone and

2069
01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:28.060
-- that if you're interested in working with us on,

2070
01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:32.050
-- I'm trying to figure this out. We are very much

2071
01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:34.530
-- welcoming of your time and talents.

2072
01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:40.170
-- Thank
-- you. Love to know what you're doing and how we can support you.

2073
01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.040
-- Well, thank you. Yeah,

2074
01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:44.160
-- very excited to um,

2075
01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:45.880
-- get connected. So

2076
01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:46.760
-- just let me know.

2077
01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:48.060
-- Cool.

2078
01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:51.560
-- I think you know about mannerist and yeah, you do.

2079
01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:54.370
-- Yeah, I'm not, I haven't been using it, but I'm familiar.

2080
01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:55.890
-- I can hop on there.

2081
01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:59.580
-- I'm the
-- one that all the hop on anything, whatever app people are using,

2082
01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:03.140
-- I'll jump in here just uh I don't have experience with any of these things,

2083
01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:05.960
-- I haven't used social media in like a decade literally, so

2084
01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:07.780
-- um there's a lot of things,

2085
01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:11.630
-- I'm just not going to know about like current events and stuff to keep that in mind,

2086
01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:15.390
-- also, like, I just may struggle to, like figure out how to use some of these things,

2087
01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:19.230
-- but I'm very curious to hear people's opinions on what

2088
01:55:19.230 --> 01:55:23.060
-- they like and don't like about certain software and applications,

2089
01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:23.560
because

2090
01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:28.450
-- didn't realize I'd end up being in this where I am now designing it, but I am, so

2091
01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:30.460
-- I need to kind of know now like

2092
01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:32.560
-- what's what's
-- out there, so

2093
01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:39.360
-- is a so the Mandamus is um where this community kind of

2094
01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:43.170
-- hangs out when we're not on calls um in the flotilla channel,

2095
01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:45.770
-- um there's another channel you might be interested

2096
01:55:45.770 --> 01:55:49.070
-- in which is a synergetic social media,

2097
01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:53.860
-- um which is kind of somebody who's working on

2098
01:55:54.740 --> 01:56:01.060
-- a uh less on virtuous uh social media

2099
01:56:01.530 --> 01:56:04.150
-- um but it's, it's also kind of a general,

2100
01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:06.880
-- you might have some good conversations there

2101
01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:08.760
-- about what's good and bad about different,

2102
01:56:08.770 --> 01:56:11.960
-- different social media platforms.

2103
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:15.060
-- Yeah, yeah, that'd be great. Just um

2104
01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:17.490
-- yeah, so do you have me the info

2105
01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:18.460
-- and I'll hop in there

2106
01:56:19.330 --> 01:56:23.120
-- and feel free again, Michael was saying the post whatever questions you have to,

2107
01:56:23.130 --> 01:56:23.950
-- I found,

2108
01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:28.430
-- I'm pretty new to to this experience as well with everyone else in collaboration.

2109
01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:31.700
-- So I found I can just speak to my own experience as saying,

2110
01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:33.540
-- I found that if you post a question,

2111
01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:37.960
-- there's plenty of people who will be like to chime in in a very supportive

2112
01:56:38.230 --> 01:56:43.970
-- way to um either, you know, bring your attention to resources, you don't know, or,

2113
01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:47.350
-- you know, answer the question directly or whatever, so however we can support you,

2114
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:48.760
-- that's what I'm getting at.

2115
01:56:48.770 --> 01:56:50.250
-- Yeah, thank you so much.

2116
01:56:52.130 --> 01:56:54.460
-- This is uh this is bigger than us, you know?

2117
01:56:57.230 --> 01:57:01.550
-- It's really cool. It's great. It's really great to meet people like yourselves,

2118
01:57:02.230 --> 01:57:06.680
-- you're too, my husband came down, I had you guys on, on you and I'm making my lunch,

2119
01:57:06.690 --> 01:57:08.650
-- and he's he just leans in, he goes,

2120
01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:11.810
-- I can't even, like, you didn't say that,

2121
01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:14.400
-- but I just know not everyone likes to have these

2122
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:17.130
-- conversations and I would try to have them with him,

2123
01:57:17.130 --> 01:57:18.770
-- and he'd be like, please, I have a headache.

2124
01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:24.490
-- Like I just he runs he runs software in his day job to seize the VP of Penzler,

2125
01:57:24.490 --> 01:57:27.510
-- which is a language learning, you know, he's developed their app.

2126
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:32.300
-- And so he's like, I can't, I can't, I can't, you know, and I'm like, please,

2127
01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:33.220
-- I really wanted this stuff

2128
01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:33.780
-- is great.

2129
01:57:33.790 --> 01:57:37.660
-- It's just nice to have a, have a forum,

2130
01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:40.050
-- talk about it with other people who are interested and we all

2131
01:57:40.050 --> 01:57:43.590
-- see the potential because it's heavy topics they start talking about,

2132
01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:46.000
-- we get into and you know,

2133
01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.880
-- I know at times it can really weigh me down and give me compassion fatigue.

2134
01:57:49.890 --> 01:57:50.780
-- So, um,

2135
01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:53.840
-- it's nice to have being an environment with people

2136
01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:56.150
-- who feel like there is a path through.

2137
01:57:56.630 --> 01:57:59.840
-- So thank you. Thank you for always holding the space and

2138
01:58:01.130 --> 01:58:01.850
-- it's been great.

2139
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:05.980
-- Thanks. I'll have a great weekend. Have

2140
01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:07.250
-- a great day. Great weekend. See you.

2141
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:08.340
-- Bye.
