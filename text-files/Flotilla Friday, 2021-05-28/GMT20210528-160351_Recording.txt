00:10:27	Bill Anderson:	Benjamin: can you put a link to the writing you were talking about here?
00:11:43	Benjamin Life:	Linked Open Wisdom Commons White Paper (work in progress, thinking out loud, super vulnerable to share such an early stage doc, open for feedback):
00:11:45	Benjamin Life:	https://roamresearch.com/#/app/CivHubxCivilizationOS/page/3MXAXzEPV
00:11:53	Bill Anderson:	when we move from flotilla to armada we will really have a naming issue
00:12:33	Peter Kaminski:	lol
00:12:33	Benjamin Life:	I‚Äôd love to talk about integrating massive wiki and trove on this call
00:12:52	Benjamin Life:	Also token curated registries, SourceCred, etc
00:21:29	Peter Kaminski:	https://hackmd.io/@peterkaminski/BkuPXq0Fu
00:25:04	vincent arena:	Charles is alluding to technologies that allow humans to use AI (transhumanism technologies that are in trials right now)
00:25:17	Benjamin Life:	BCI 4 GOOD
00:25:21	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Yes that's the been the transhumanist claim forever
00:25:32	vincent arena:	(having google or trove or massive literally plugged into your brain)
00:26:02	Benjamin Life:	I believe our organic capacities are exponentially more powerful when leveraged.
00:26:20	Benjamin Life:	These rational materialists ain‚Äôt got nothin on non-dual Gnostic genius
00:26:27	Marc-Antoine Parent:	I believe in augmentation, but I don't need it requires neural ink.
00:27:36	Marc-Antoine Parent:	But there's a fact that even without the neuralink, there's a polarization in how we use information. some people thrive in the info-rich medium of the net, others become lazy because it's out there.
00:30:32	Bill Anderson:	and Pete that is with AI that is not that ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù
00:30:53	charles blass:	cicolab monday howard rheingold in thee hot seat on smart mob politics
00:30:58	Marc-Antoine Parent:	and breaking things
00:31:07	Benjamin Life:	Propositional knowing is just one way of knowing. Semantic web is only propositional.
00:31:19	charles blass:	then we discuss the blackpaper, after howard
00:31:24	Benjamin Life:	We‚Äôre still in flesh suits on a living earth.
00:31:27	Bill Anderson:	Benjamin - bingo!
00:32:49	vincent arena:	(be right back)
00:33:54	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	The Gray Newell vid that Charles referred to:

00:34:44	Bill Anderson:	not quite everybody has access to what, say, I have
00:35:11	Benjamin Life:	Human networks can beat the borg.
00:36:17	Benjamin Life:	Machine learning permaculture ü§îüòÆüòü
00:36:35	Benjamin Life:	Cosmo-local networks
00:36:40	Benjamin Life:	Grounded yet connected
00:36:52	Benjamin Life:	What gets erased in the connection and abstraction?
00:37:10	Benjamin Life:	Globalists derive power from erasure.
00:37:48	Marc-Antoine Parent:	http://www.open-atlas.org/
00:39:13	Marc-Antoine Parent:	https://www.communecter.org/#home
00:39:23	Benjamin Life:	I think this conversation could ground a bit in the context of the link between trove and massive wiki
00:39:38	charles blass:	+1
00:40:58	Marc-Antoine Parent:	It has to be a federation effort!
00:44:45	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Benjamin would love to talk about epistemological commons! maparent@acm.org
00:45:58	Bill Anderson:	Benjamin and Marc-Antoine: me too.
00:47:27	charles blass:	MessyWiki
00:47:28	Marc-Antoine Parent:	as in Bruno Latour?
00:47:31	Bill Anderson:	the big ‚ÄúO‚Äù Ontology
00:48:16	Bill Anderson:	Bruno Latour
00:50:17	Benjamin Life:	Finally found a decent link for my integral ontology reference.

00:51:27	Peter Kaminski:	John Vervaeke's lecture series ‚ÄúAwakening from the Meaning Crisis‚Äù
00:57:26	Bill Anderson:	move into information space (what is that?)
00:58:54	Bill Anderson:	connective intelligence information spaces
01:00:08	Benjamin Life:	Collaboratively generated source of truth contrasted with collaboratively generated clusters of sources of truth
01:01:05	Bill Anderson:	the four sides to every story: your side, my side, the truth, and what really happened
01:02:34	Benjamin Life:	I‚Äôm seeing the need for another tool that works with massive wiki to work through branching and integration. Thinking about SourceCred on Discourse forums for the dialectic process. Source of truth ie wiki represents the emergent consensus of the branches.
01:02:52	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Benjamin we really should talk...
01:04:29	vincent arena:	sorry everyone dealing with some issues right now have to run. have fun!
01:08:53	Benjamin Life:	Including cognitive bias and emotional trauma response.
01:10:51	Marc-Antoine Parent:	between public and private, the translucent/porous boundaries....
01:11:27	Peter Kaminski:	"translucent" work
01:15:20	Benjamin Life:	Permissions, attribution (value flows), and  identity are all hard problems associated with collective intelligence.
