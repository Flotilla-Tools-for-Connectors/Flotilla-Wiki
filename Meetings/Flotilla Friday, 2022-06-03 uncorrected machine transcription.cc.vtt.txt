00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Yeah, Thank you.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So this little Friday, sometime in June, June 2022. Is it the second or the third third, third of June. Yeah.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I just had a quick update on apis so one of the things that I have been doing this week is experimenting with a two-way sync with air, table, and catalyst.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And so i've been doing some cool things like for a member directory.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
If somebody like edits their profile and catalyst, and that profile is in a group which has the integration set up.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Then as soon as like they change their email it'll go and do a Api request, and it'll overwrite the email that's in the air table for that user profile

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So it requires a little bit of setup or just kind of creating a new integrate

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We're losing you vincent we can't hear you

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We are experiencing technical difficulties. Please stand by

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:47.000
You couldn't hear me laughing well said

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So today's the last day of mercury and retrograde, which could explain why we're experiencing these difficulties

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:18.000
You wanna try. Now then, set

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Yeah, we still can hear you.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I guess he's gonna try to come back on or or is then that just dropped

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000
What would you like to share? Hmm. working on decentralization?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Jordan. I got got it set up so that we can get the Lionsburg wiki going.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
It's actually going and now, we mostly have it set up on the web

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And i'll be finishing off for the next couple of days we're

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I was thinking about that yesterday, because when somebody said, What is decentralization, I would have loved to just like, go around the room and see how people you know felt about that.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So for me. I think of like freedom and choice But it occurred later on, just thinking about like God.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And then Lionsburg, this mythical creation that everybody wants to be a Lionsburg and follow me for a minute

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Yeah, I forgot, we're recording that mine i'll save it for another time we can.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
We can pass the recording and come back i'll i'll Pause it.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Okay, yeah, okay, Although I think I don't think I have control
