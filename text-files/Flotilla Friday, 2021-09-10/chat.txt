09:09:04	 From Bill Anderson : warehouses and storehouses
09:09:33	 From Bill Anderson : faster, easier navigation
09:09:59	 From Peter Kaminski : in some recent call, i was talking about data warehouses, data lakes, datamarts, etc.  separate discussion, but sort of parallel language
09:10:01	 From Bill Anderson : individual use -> better thinking -> collaboration
09:10:47	 From Bill Anderson : i’ll supply the corn
09:11:07	 From Bill Anderson : visual thinking
09:11:35	 From Bill Anderson : but also visualizing thinking (this is meta)
09:12:42	 From Bill Anderson : https://www.wisdomtree.app/ yes?
09:15:07	 From Mark Carranza : https://obsidian.md/
09:21:22	 From Bill Anderson : positive psychology
09:22:10	 From Peter Kaminski : connections and creative thinking
09:26:12	 From Bill Anderson : the three Rs are fundamental to education
09:27:46	 From Bill Anderson : what is info? knowledge? primary Qs; links between info/context more important than hierarchy organization; improve capture first
09:28:32	 From Bill Anderson : free-assocations
09:31:55	 From Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com : Getting past the constriction of the library shelf.
09:32:05	 From Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com : Using metadata and tagging to let things be in many “places”.
09:32:13	 From Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com : Random access via search leads to exploring connections > finding related info > people > groups > movements
09:32:31	 From Bill Anderson : oral cultures do not have a concept of information search
09:33:05	 From Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com : Point taken :)
09:33:53	 From Wendy McLean : Sometimes we want to just get the resource (individual learning), and sometimes we want to play with others in discovery (classroom or conference room) and sometimes we’re exploring something so new, we tell stories that need witnessing to help us make sense of it.
09:33:54	 From Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com : Random access withOUT search, then.
09:34:24	 From Wendy McLean : How can we mirror all three experiences in one platform or one UI?
09:34:38	 From Bill Anderson : i am getting confused now about the meaning of the noun “story”
09:35:49	 From Bill Anderson : pete asserts knowledge == stories
09:35:52	 From Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com : Is a story a container?
09:36:00	 From Bill Anderson : +1 michael
09:37:30	 From Wendy McLean : A story could be a collection of connections and associations between info, to help us ‘hold’ the information.  OR. It could be a personal story of sharing something that happened in order to ‘find’ others with similar experiences to connect to another person.  OR you could combine ‘stories’ to sensemake the experience of a community and find needs/ holes/ benefits/ successes
09:40:48	 From Bill Anderson : what is a fact before it is a fact?
09:42:56	 From Bill Anderson : in science “without models there are no data” - so data is itself not so simple
09:43:34	 From Mark Carranza : https://todayinsci.com/M/Maxwell_James/MaxwellJames-Quotations.htm
09:44:38	 From Peter Kaminski : i like this, Bill: "oral cultures do not have a concept of information search"  my guess is that we'll become an oral culture for information, where we talk to AI bots instead of reading/writing/searching, and also a visual culture -- logos, emojis, video -- for things like awareness and grabbing attention.  i think reading/writing mostly goes away in 25, 50, 100 years, except for nostalgia geeks and super specialists.
09:45:09	 From Peter Kaminski : "slow culture"
09:45:19	 From Mark Carranza : A memorandum-book does not, provided it is neatly written, appear confused to an illiterate person, or to the owner who understands it thoroughly, but to any other person able to read it appears to be inextricably confused.
09:47:45	 From Peter Kaminski : VRML
09:49:36	 From Peter Kaminski : https://web.archive.org/web/20040319183204/http://www.kafka.org/briefe/Brod/1904/br04-003.html
09:51:47	 From Bill Anderson : the oral culture notion is from Lewis Hyde, A Primer for Forgetting: getting past the past http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1222828730
09:51:54	 From Peter Kaminski : :-)
09:56:03	 From Vincent Arena : Who do you curate for? Who do you wiki for? You? Others? Both?
09:56:07	 From Bill Anderson : putting into a folder for later is “chunking”
09:56:12	 From Mark Carranza : Alas, have to go!
09:57:27	 From Peter Kaminski : +1 Vincent. the thing i want is "we wiki together, for one another and for the group, and for those who will come later."
10:01:25	 From Wendy McLean : +1 Peter
10:03:22	 From Vincent Arena : This is tangential but should we update the flotilla site? Seems it’s telling a story that we are gathered around a single berry bush not doing much, when we really have a whole forest we’re playing in :)
10:03:26	 From Wendy McLean : +1 Michael!
10:04:35	 From Peter Kaminski : yep, we should update the flotilla site.  i'll be on that team.  who else wants to work on it?
10:04:53	 From Wendy McLean : Both are good: I’m in crises and can’t curate info right now, but I can trust that the community has already for me.  Or that I have the free time to curate and capture knowing that others will eventually use it.
10:06:42	 From Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com : +1 Wendy
10:06:51	 From Wendy McLean : Except for Nextdoor app!  Where people post similar things for their neighbors
10:07:13	 From Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com : I’m game to help a bit on the Flotilla site
10:10:50	 From Peter Kaminski : unless somebody else has super energy about a different way to publish the flotilla site, i'll make it a massive wiki that gets published to static html, and help Flotilla people interface with / edit the text of the site.
10:13:26	 From Zeek : perspective, meaning, intent
10:13:52	 From Zeek : resiliency
10:14:32	 From Wendy McLean : +1 zeek!!!
10:16:51	 From Wendy McLean : The limit of stories is that it doesn’t summarize or have a bottom-line conclusion in and of itself.  Rather, it’s more exploratory.
10:19:13	 From Wendy McLean : Our thinking diverges to include stories and sense make, then we converge and put it into different forms to be able to act on it, then we expand into various stories again, then converge again.
10:33:32	 From Vincent Arena : I have to run! Pete can a massive wiki static site have iframe embeds?
10:34:11	 From Peter Kaminski : Vincent, yes
10:34:20	 From Wendy McLean : Bye Vincent!!
10:36:26	 From Zeek : i come from the scientific mindset of trying to prove things false rather than trying to ‘prove’ them “true” so the word fact to me is a bit confusing lol
10:36:36	 From Peter Kaminski : +1 zeek
10:42:50	 From Wendy McLean : Like TB-Lee’s Solid project
10:43:09	 From Zeek : very similiar concepts yes
10:51:53	 From Wendy McLean : For truth / fact checking with a line between tech and people input, check out Kinzen
10:52:24	 From Peter Kaminski : random link about oracular AGIs: https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/oracle-ai

10:57:11	 From Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com : Wendy, was this the Time Tax article?
10:57:15	 From Zeek : thanks!
