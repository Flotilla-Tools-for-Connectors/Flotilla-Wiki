09:02:22 From CSC Zoom to Everyone : https://hackmd.io/@peterkaminski/r1EupmyCu
09:10:55 From Mark Carranza to Everyone : Hi and bye !
09:18:07 From CSC Zoom to Everyone : i like Vincent's fractal vision here, _and_, I would love to see a gallery of fractal scales.  in my previous call, we were looking at the fractal scales of biology from mitochondria, single-celled orgs, multicellular orgs, up to complex organisms like worms and dogs and humans -- and then fractal levels of social structures -- tribes, villages, cities, nations, multinational corps, etc.
09:18:46 From CSC Zoom to Everyone : another fractal scale is (i think) mandelbrot's example of coastlines, all the way from grains of sand to a whole coastline
09:31:57 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : https://savvycal.com/
09:32:39 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : the savvycal site has comparisons with:  Calendly
YouCanBook.me
Acuity Scheduling
Meetingbird
Doodle
Woven
X.ai

09:58:33 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : Annie Murphy Paul - The Extended Mind
10:07:26 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : "The Extended Mind - The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain" book by Annie Murphy Paul  (just reposting Bill, but in a format a parser of the future will pick up as a book :-))
10:08:03 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : and also a website:  https://anniemurphypaul.com/books/the-extended-mind/
10:08:10 From vincent arena to Everyone : Wendy and I spoke with tom!
10:09:19 From Peter Kaminski to Everyone : "... but they are limited by their assumption that thinking happens only inside the brain. Much less attention has been paid to the ways in which people use the world to think: the gestures of the hands, the space of a sketchbook, the act of listening to someone tell a story or the task of teaching someone else. These “extra-neural” inputs change the way we think; it could even be said that they constitute a part of the thinking process itself. "
10:14:32 From Bill Anderson to Everyone : https://band.trinket.io/scientific-data-informatics#/scientific-data-informatics/data-is-information
