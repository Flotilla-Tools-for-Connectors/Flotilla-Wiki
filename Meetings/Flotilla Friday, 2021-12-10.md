Ward sez,

As arrows is a drawing tool, I would like to inform you that I use a different one:
https://dmx.berlin/
https://search.maven.org/artifact/systems.dmx/dmx-storage-neo4j/5.2.1/bundle
https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-platform/dmx-platform.git

I see DMX has a lot to offer. Skimming the plugin authoring guide I notice a departure from both Neo4j and Graphviz:

Aside: I've shown this to Neo4j experts who have not been impressed. I think this is because they live in a world where they improve the representation of data they have. The value in this diagram is that I can see what I have and also how I learned it. In a world where all sources are incomplete and out of sync this is crucial for writing robust queries an interpreting their results.
