00:53:47	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Vincent’s question
00:54:33	Marc-Antoine Parent:	Tangentially related question: Massive vs https://www.netlifycms.org ?
00:57:42	Wendy McLean, NY:	A related question: how much collaboration will happen during meetings vs after meetings?
00:58:38	Wendy McLean, NY:	I’m more likely to collaborate during, rather than after.
00:59:22	Vincent Arena:	I mostly agree ^^
00:59:35	Wendy McLean, NY:	I love the idea of “integrating” or “mining” the notes during one meeting to make sure we bring forward the most important info into the dashboard and highlighting it for the repo.
