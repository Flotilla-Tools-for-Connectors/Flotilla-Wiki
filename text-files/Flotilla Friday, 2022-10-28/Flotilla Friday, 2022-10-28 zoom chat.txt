00:47:05	Michael Grossman (Factr):	Sam, I overheard you describe your stack, and it very heavily overlaps Factr’s. We don’t use Fastify (to my knowledge—I’m similarly a non-technical founder), but everything else you mentioned, we do.
00:47:47	Michael Grossman (Factr):	Vincent, sure! DM me or whatever.

01:18:56	Wendy McLean, NY:	When we collaborate, we begin to share common resources.  The more we do that, the more we all benefit, the more the whole system is successful.  Competition for resources eventually leads to a strain on the resources, competition gets more intense, and we all loose.  The former facilitates a sense of abundance, the latter facilitates a sense of lack.
01:30:01	Wendy McLean, NY:	Such a pleasure meeting you Sam.  Hope to see you here again.  Pleasure everyone!  Thanks for the discussion.  Have a great weekend.  Happy Halloween!
