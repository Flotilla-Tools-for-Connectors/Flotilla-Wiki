### Potential Needs

- interoperability

- multiple different maps from different perspectives
- "filtering" a large set of nodes
- easy to reuse the same nodes
- the information for a node is always up-to-date
- dynamic generation of a map
- collaboration on a map
- aggregation of data from various web endpoints
- syndication of data, hosting of data
- search metadata
- going from viewing a map to being able to add to the map things that i know about
- a unique (distributed) identifier for each organization and individual
    - DNS domain name
    - need something else for entities without a domain name
