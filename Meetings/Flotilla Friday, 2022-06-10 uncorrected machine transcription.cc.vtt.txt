WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
do that. Thank you.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Dan is your colleague. we We We participated in this year long leadership course called team management leadership program.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It just ended And yeah, we got a lot out of it.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
At least I did. and i'll share my screen I'm. not sure if you guys already seen this have you already seen this.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I never showed them you're into possibility when did it?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Okay, great. So I will share

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Okay, So let's. go to the this is a project you know through this program that we took because just being able to kind of create from nothing.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Right. You know what what really I wanted to do is bring my full self.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So bringing in my like data background my kind of love for creating websites.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This passion for storytelling to create

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You know spaces for people to see how interconnectedly are.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So I create this website to to kind of achieve all those things.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And just to kind of share possibility a bit inter possibility.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So this was something I came up with actually, in the summer of 2020, when you know things were.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We have the Black Lives matter, movement or summer. you know.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I was back home in Georgia, where I grew up with my siblings.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Yeah, no, because we're also in you know but pan down as well.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Couldn't really hang and I wanted to do something Oh, we had in a big election that year as well

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So my way of doing something was creating the website where I would sell hats, and those hats were kind of a play on make America great again.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But it was purple. and it read: Make America Love.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Now, and I use the revenue generated from selling those hats to donate to various causes like sunrise movements.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
There was some other initiatives that i'm thinking that.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But oh, yeah, campaign 0. other ones Someone say something.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I have a question. So yeah, the idea around and back.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Then it was called Love. now and love, now, you know, still has the same tenets as what the name is called now.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Inter possibility. and those tenets are. We are in a community, you know.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We affect each other through our actions and in actions, whether we know it or not.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And i'll read what we have here we deal with insecurities.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Fear and shame are motivated by what we believe to be good and right.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So that you know what I mean by that. is like we have You know our our our light side, and then there's also just like this kind of when I call it dark.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:30.000
You know we have our shame. We have our issues there here that we have, we insecurities like that, and rejecting that at least from my personal kind of journey.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:46.000
You know I have gotten a lot of like being more accepting of my full self right, and i'm wondering if everyone we're able to do that. so so given that we're interconnected doing that we're

00:03:46.000 --> 00:04:02.000
all whole and complete. We have this powerful choice to choose to take care of ourselves, and what I mean by that is is you know, promoter, collective, flourishing and and that could look you know, like different.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Like it looks. yeah. it could go many different ways, you know when it comes to all of like our

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I'm not calling problems, but opportunities when it comes to just like climate change.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
You know how we take care of each other you know we're dealing with

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:31.000
We're actually meeting ourselves off from the pandemic we are gun control all of the issues, at least in America, you know.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:41.000
We? What would it look like? good present to these Okay, and I have it that we can make a powerful choice to go.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Okay, So that's the the concept. Now, going back to this game I want to call it a game.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I've been calling it a game you know I had folks complete a form. essentially.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And you know that Forum is here embedded into this this particular page.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And if i'll i'll let everyone actually yeah complete, and Silas i'll send the share the link.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But at the end here the end result is you know created these 2 visualizations here.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So it's like a global map where you can see participants.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Who have played this game and where they are in the world.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And then these kind of links are to like participant, and who referred them.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
This game, so that's all captured through this form completing this form.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Take 6Â min and then here's another visualization

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So these are again all the participants who have played and if you hover over folks, you can see who they are in the world.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So again I don't want to but if you do and play this game.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It's just another up. This is an opportunity to define oneself in a different way. So for me. you can see we have the center here.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I think I mentioned that fully self express inspiring and fun and i'm based in brooklyn

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I guess i'll stay for me, hey? stacey here honest, loving, and joyful.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Nay, I United States can see, Dan, you know, is fraud pulling off of Stacy and see how things connected to me.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Dan is generous, loving, and committed, and all the people who participated from Dan.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I love that, and then we have. Wendy. Wendy, I think, is on the call, and then we have project not as a Wendy.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:02.000
You are creative, wise and compassionate from South Salem, nonjudgmental affirming and fund Gotcha from pronouncing that correctly.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So yeah, this is fun. It was just a fun project, and I want it to, You know.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I I have to say like sometimes we get. I was like busy, and you know, cost money to kind of, you know.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Pay for this form to be like live So I discontinued it.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And then Stacy. you know I I met Stacy, and she said, and somehow found all of like the back story that I shared with you.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
You know, through just Google searching and you know, was really enrolled by this project.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So I actually resurrected it yeah and we'll continue to keep it live.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:54.000
In the next goal is to automate it. I would love to just like have someone complete this and then audit and have the for these visualizations automatically updated.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So that's the next step now that I have a little more time.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So yeah, that's that is what i'm up to here any questions concerned comments.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Thank you.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I will. Yeah, I found that I found filling out the questionnaire really lovely, too.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
It's been a little bit since I filled it out but it inspired me enough that I shared it with other people.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So. yeah I mean i'm i'm some of us on this call have been working on different mapping projects and one that i'm working on.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I call the tapestry, but it really to me it's not about how we visualize it, although visualizing.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
It is fun, and tells the story as you were saying so so Well, to me it's about letting ourselves be seen right.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:56.000
It's about it's not what visual we use it's like any visual is good at just helping the unseen be seen. and I like the way that you phrase the questions to bring out things that are less typically the things

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
we ask each other when we need each other. And I really liked that, too.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So I think if I had a question it would be, What are you hoping to do with this?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
If you had a vision for what you know, besides creating just the change that comes with seeing each other.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:22.000
There's a lot great richness right there but are you do you have a hope, or that the ripple effect will eventually do something, or I have lots of thoughts about that from my own stuff.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So I was just curious whether or you had the same. Yeah.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:36.000
You know I did. I want to honestly just see it grow and have it.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Grow organically and automatically. so if I allow people to play this game.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:53.000
It's easy for them to participate it's easy to update the this particular. the visualizations that will be a huge achievement from there, you know.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I I'm not sure I think you know i'm thinking about like Brand.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:17.000
You know i'm thinking about like this inter possibility in the idea as like something I can just you know, apply in different areas, whether it's through just like clothing, whether it's through just like one thing I actually have been

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:26.000
dreaming about is like having kind of similar to like clothing houses that have like their seasonal.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I guess, like drops. What I would do is like have a seasonal like drop of content, or some sort of storytelling.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Content that I would just release you know maybe like twice a year, so it could be in any form I could think of like something like this just like interactive.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Maybe it's like a short film again. that kind of promotes the idea around inter possibility.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And then couple that with like merchandise, and just again, ways to kind of like grow the idea

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And then I with my team. When I was creating this, we had dreams of having this be like a physical exhibit at a museum as well.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:44.000
You know things like that so just kind of like growing the it, and in any way like those are some of the the ideas that I have come

00:11:44.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I will can tell everybody's looking at your site and with these intense spaces. filling it out, or there. I think I'm the only one who's filled it out before Besides, stacey I can tell they're

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
all,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Yeah, , I I like how. The form is not just about like answering the question.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:21.000
But then you kind of make people but you kinda make people go back afterwards and reflect on their answers.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
There's a little bit of yeah like the form kind of changes you a little bit, or at least have your answer.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Yeah. Yeah, it was. It was a fun like kind of how can I create what feels like an in-person conversation like a one on one conversation virtually was like something that I wanted to to software.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:52.000
So type form was like the best to kind of the closest tool to achieve that

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Cool, cool, and the tool you're using for the visualizations is flourish right for both of us exactly florish.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:16.000
See, I don't think it should be too hard to automate from type form to flourish because I know Flourish has a a pretty good api that you could update information after a form is submitted and maybe you could

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.000
use sap here for that as like a first step I'm not sure familiar with Apr.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
If you've tried that yeah I I didn't see a what do we call it within Jp.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Or like an integration. And see, I guess like could you hang in generic Api: Yeah.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.000
So basically And this is actually just good. information for anyone who's like trying to do some automations.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:14:03.000
If zapier doesn't have an integration with you know, for example, like flourish. what you could do is there is a a step? which is, I believe, just like, do a post request, or do a get request?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Like you can just do I i'll tell you what it's called exactly.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000
I need to sign in but you can basically do. You could define your own Api call with any

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Any software, and it doesn't Have to be like any software you can do the same thing with into integration, with which I think just change their name to something else.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
They're a little cheaper. p do you know they change their name, too.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I do not that's news to me actually looks like what is that?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Oh, yeah, okay, I think that's it

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000
You're new to this group collection. but this is a very conversational group, so I can tell everyone's really dived into your bank.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Yes, of the looks on everyone's face isn't the intensity that's cool.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Take a look at it back

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Grappling. the fact that I created started creating started answering the questions and hit the back button at 1 point, and I think i'm gone back to the lead page, and so I don't know if i'm double creating a

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000
pretty, and they'll be 2 of me or thank you, It should be good, I think it should be good.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I? I think the cookie, Should she bring it back to where you left off?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Let me know it. I mean the cookies aren't bringing back to where I left off it's starting at the beginning.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:25.000
But but no i'll just start again okay

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
What were you just thinking? When did? Yeah, I I had a question for Clutch?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:38.000
But he looks like he's in the middle of something

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
What kind of time you're spending at like is this taking?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Is this just kind of one of those projects is kind of off on the side for you, and you're just curious about it, and put some time in every now and then.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Or is it something that you're looking to expand right now or is it, I'm.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Wondering if, like what you what you might need from this group which is maybe a hard thing for you to frame, because you don't know us very well. but i'm kind of wondering how we can help support your work.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And whether there's some synergies and opportunities for weeding our efforts together, , if you want me to describe what we're you know what i'm working on and have some other people do that first, we

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:22.000
can also do that. But I was just curious

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:41.000
It's I just have a feeling that this group is itching to kind of take this or like combination of a lot of things to a level that I am not present to i'd really love you all to explain

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
what you're doing? because that's really why I wanted collect you to come here?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Because I think he can see something that I won't be able to explain.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:57.000
So I really want you all to know each other. Yeah, I mean, I can start.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
I think other rebel might still be filling out forums.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000
I can start so i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna tell a story.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Then talk about the specific projects because to me it's not so much about the projects as it is like where we're all trying to go.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.000
So I tend to be a person who's a mirror my background is in psychology actually not in tech or coding, or anything like that.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:31.000
I just recognize that tech has a big role to play and where we're trying to go so for me. whether i'm trying to be a mirror for people to see themselves better by have you know, sitting down and having a

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
one-on-one conversation with them, or that i'm trying to provide a encourage it.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Some something from a tech perspective to be built to me it's doing the same thing.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
It's providing a mirror right either me or to community right?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000
So the data visualization matters greatly right from that perspective which i'm sure can see you nodding.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
I'm sure you appreciate too, so for me the ui ux stuff is more again.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
I don't code i'm not you youux designer, but I appreciate that.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
So I tend to be a weaver right so i'm looking for all the pieces to put together.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Whether it's the tech pieces or it's the community pieces of the facilitation pieces, or the I'm I'm usually thinking in those ways, and trying to provide you know a mural board or a document or something to help people

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:29.000
see what i'm visualizing from that perspective and to throw it into the center, into the soup to see what see what happens, and see how it changes conversation and things like that in that i'm also tends to be a systems person where

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
i'm on i'm often seeing the holes in things because I am trying to take that view.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:45.000
So if I see a hole and I see if filling that hole would help, I try to fill it, you know, either by connecting people together, or by filling it myself, so that the entire system can rise together.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:20:02.000
So I i'm often looking for that aspect in the visualizations as well, and seeing that one of the things that was really missing was for me a way for community to 2 aspects that are missing and data visualizations

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
from my perspective mostly as a user of the of the information.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
One is I need to added my own information so if you're presenting the not you specifically.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:21.000
But if I get a data visualization, and I can't interact with it in a way, or and edit it, or move it, or shape it in a way that speaks. then speaks to me, then to me it feels more like a one

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:30.000
shot view of something. I get that story, and then I move on. and I was looking for something that was be more interactive and engaging, so that people felt like they wanted to come back to it.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:41.000
That it kept informing them. And then the other thing was giving a holistic view of a community, so that the leaders could see where synergies are Well, actually So individuals could do.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
See where the synergies are and see where the gaps are right.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:57.000
So it's a lot to ask of technology the way it's built Now, to be able to have kind of a global view of things in my own personal view of things and to be able to to add notes and edit things the way, I

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
want to , you know it's it becomes more than just the visualization.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
It becomes a whole knowledge repository at the come right so it starts expanding and expanding.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
So I've tried to take little bite side pieces bite size pieces of it.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
See. What can we just create like this little piece of it?

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Which is hard, because the second I feel like i've shown things to people.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:26.000
They go. Well, that's really nice but could we have like this huge thing, you know It's hard to take a bite size piece that that actually how that works the way.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
We want it to work technically, but also helps and supports the ultimate goals.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:41.000
At the same time. it always feels like it's lacking just a little bit like like the tools that we need right now to create the tools that we need like.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
We need the tools to create the tools so i'm i'm stuck in that a little bit in that little place.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:58.000
I work. I come to this group because not only do I really love the people in this in this meeting, and I've always appreciated our conversations, and it's such a nice community.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:09.000
But we talk here about how that our different things that we're working on can work together better, and how we can use the data or use the concepts to help each other support each other.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:17.000
And then on the technical side, which is less, me but more more of other people in this group. it's also about the technical interoperability of things.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
So. so I I currently have a project running called tapestry for me.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
I'm trying to really get simplified with it now and go okay.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:38.000
If I use it for me. What do, I really want it for and right now i'm trying to weave a bunch of projects together from people that I know, and I'm seeing how they fit together, and I am keep trying to find ways

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
to express that really well, so that other people see what I see.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
And i'm i'm struggling and so i'm trying to use my own tool.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
I've developed my own 2 to a point where things that feel like they're They're at the fringe edges.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Start to realize that they're actually connected hope that made sense Can you give me an example of that like, Yeah, if you if you don't mind if you have like, like those those like someone over here is working on hollow

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
chain. Someone over here is working on trail marks. right?

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.000
How do we help them understand that, even though they might have walked slightly from has actually ending up in a very similar place?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
And how and how do we help those 2 people find the synergies there and then develop a project from that?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:36.000
And then hopefully, funding comes after that, so but it starts with the awareness that these 2 people don't know each other yet, But they're in similar circles, right?

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.000
They're already connected in some ways and how do we help them recognize that they're actually working on in on something similar.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Now it's obviously up to them where they decide to collaborate or not right?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
It's not about that it's really just bringing the awareness more quickly, because, of course, that'll happen over time they could meet.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:05.000
They could talk i'm trying to have tech help us create the since. See the synergies more quickly Now, if they're actually just working on 2 parallel things, and they need to keep running peril fine like Listen this

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:13.000
isn't about forcing anything right simply about finding the potential overlaps. I know one person over here that's working on governance.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Another person over here that's working on governance another person over here that's working on governance.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
One's got a slightly legal bent once got a slightly economic spent.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Once got a secondly, slightly financial Ben. How do we? Are they working on the same thing, not working on the same thing?

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Do I invite them to meet each other? Do I not about right?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
If they, if I could have something in tech that would, they could fill out.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:40.000
No one wants to add in yet another profile right but if it's something that they could fill out something simply and then maybe come back to and add on to over time.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Then I would imagine they would start to find each other better.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000
This is, I I haven't seen anything technologically you know designed.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:02.000
That helps with that step. right? It wants to capture all my data, but it's not really helping make those overlapping synergies, or even better yet.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Sometimes highlighting the gaps and things cause i'm a if I'm running a community, I want to know not only who's in my community, and what maybe next step I should take as a Communist I have a meeting, about

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:25.000
governance, because I just learned that, like half my community is actually connected to government governance in some way, then maybe we should have hold a summit, but also just as important as we have no artists, and we have no you know nobody from a

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000
spiritual side or nobody from the indigenous side and Maybe it would be wise to invite those people to a different another kind of meeting. right?

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
So it's both as the leader So I see both on an individual level and on a leader level.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
And then even, you know, and then scaling it obviously is a whole nother perspective.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:49.000
But did that help it? did? Yes, thank you. Yeah.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Yeah. So I could see a project like you, the the gift that you have and using technology to to feel more welcoming, to feel more human.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Not that it'll ever replace I don't think anybody here thinks that technology is meant to replace creativity or create right but that.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
But to help us get just a little further down. It does it?

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
That does right. Technology can do that. we don't want to make technology more than it is.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:30.000
But I think if if technology was designed for people, not for sales, right, if technology was designed for efficiencies of connection with, then I think we would.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000
We would be able to use it for more than we're using it for now, and feel much more satisfied with the results.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
So I that's the piece that I feel like I can see an inter possibility that is already emerging.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:53.000
That is, that is super important in this realm Of how do we use Tech to help connect people

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Yeah, Oh, yes, thank you for sharing because i'm present to you this kind of the goal that you're getting at right is to like again, not for just like profit seeking.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:28.000
It's more of like No, we wanna just connect people who are moving, and so that we can create efficiencies to get to where we need to go while out, which is like kind of what the possibility is like like collective

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.000
flourishing. Oh, cool, i'm present Yes, and that's where it started for me was flourishing.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
So my my driving question is Why? aren't we all already thriving?

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Because we have what we need But we're not using the resources as well, or we're not capitalizing of people string resources being very broad, just broad definition, right?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
We're not using people's strengths in the right places at the right times, right?

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
We're not allowing people's brilliance to rise up who maybe don't have marketing degrees right?

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
So they don't right. So how do we how do we bring all that.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
How a given opportunity to bring all that stuff to the 4 and technology hasn't been designed to do that?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000
But what if what if it was

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Mark Antwan, Can I ask you to introduce yourself?

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Gonna ask you off cause I want to hear it

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Sure I'm, I did go through the process and what I'm interested in is alignment not so much what Wendy was describing, though I guess that's absolutely part of it.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:57.000
But the alignment of vision alignment of understanding and so i'm very i'm a bit mindy, So i'm interested in the representation of 2 points and worldview so that we can start

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:04.000
comparing those worldviews. the I was thinking about.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
And so I worked on a few collected intelligence tools.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Ideal loom is an old tool, since craft is a new tool, the hyper knowledge is a kind of background research project for all of this.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Yeah. The The big question for me is good that our presentation for expressing the plurality a few points other than that.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:52.000
What else to say? other than this work aspect i'm trying to sometimes remember that having buddhist and to meditate, and yes, I live Montreal and that's most of what I have to say in a in

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000
terms of What you're saying about finding these gaps between projects, Wendy.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Oh, yeah, I would ask, you what is it you don't expect to be able to do on the catalyst

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000
So let me try that question. Your question is, where is kind of limited for me?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Is that what you mean, like what is Kyle is not doing for that goal.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000
But maybe I should let other the presentation around finish but address but i'd really like to throw this question at you.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Yeah, tell me, i'll answer quickly and then for me It's seeing the connections between things right is right.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:43.000
So Vincent's Troops are fabulous and but it's hard to visualize all the connections, you know, so it's almost like Kumu on top or seriously on top or right like that's the

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
piece , Okay,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Vincent, don't want to go actually I need to go check on my grammar real quick.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
So you guys in circle packed me up your back

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Michael Pete,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000
I'm waiting for Michael to jump in

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Hi, collitch it's nice to meet you you doing cool stuff.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:33.000
So stacy What what's this game again what's what game?

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000
This game that i'm asking i'm asking you to introduce yourself.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Well, so I can play that a bunch of different ways right and and you probably don't.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000
I was embarrassed. How ugly my tech looks basically looking at Colleties.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000
So I had to find some tech that, or I. I had to find some some artistic stuff.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
So let me show you some artistic stuff that I haven't shown people much pizza and overachiever.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000
I'm just gonna throw that in here i'm fine it's interesting that everyone's feeling shy.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:24.000
This is kind of cute. So this I I had to find this and say, Yeah, I've actually got a a decent eye for art, and I like making art and stuff like that.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
The so. the the funny thing is, I I like colors and patterns and stuff like that.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
So a lot of these things make me they just make me happy just looking at them but then

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000
What's that? I love these I was saying thank you for showing this?

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Then I take it took a second look and it's like I there's a whole nother thing i've been playing around with the Ai the ai image generator tools and i've i've

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
curated like. So you don't create stuff with with ai art generate?

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Is your curate stuff. So the generators i've played with.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Basically, you you poke around with them simple words for like dozens of times.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
And so out of a 100 things, you find one or 2 that are like, Oh, wow!

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
I can share this, and it looks interesting, or or you can take it apart a little bit and put it back together in a slightly different way.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
So. So then I was looking at these and go damn.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000
So these are from like 15 or 20 years ago, Damn did what this basically is.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.000
I can look at these and know how they were created, and stuff a lot of it is just curation.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Combinations of pallets and jimmy transformations and stuff, and it's it's kinduration.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:34:01.000
So so cliche one of the things i'm really good at is curating and editorial editorial decision making and that's a lot of what this is So So then i'm like isn't there

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:12.000
anything that I actually made by hand. And and this is a really interesting explanation of how to brighten, brighten up a an image in Photoshop, and with some different layers.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
And and the tricks that you use to get a nice balance thing.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:25.000
But I actually this is my grandmother so again. this is something where i'm more curating than creating.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
So this is a it's colorized from a black and white photo and and cleaned up a lot and stuff like that.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:44.000
So, anyway. so oh, actually! So let me show you the ugly stuff.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:35:06.000
This is a good example. so so i've got a project called the Massive Massive wiki And so a lot of what I do is I try to help people connect to each other and work together so a lot

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
of that work in my life has been working on wikis and this is I.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:29.000
I've got a project called massive wiki which it's it's a the idea to provide classic wiki utility with various tools and processes that enable decentralization and

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Federation. So So the good news is massive.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Wiki is actually really cool, and bad news is the this is the prettiest prettiest look that it has right Now, which is, it's totally fine, but it's not great or anything like that cause our architecturally it's it's

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:57.000
a sweet So if you if you appreciate architecture there's a lot of cool stuff about it, so the things

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:05.000
I've been doing it for a long I i've been I've been in tech for since like 1919 80 or so so.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
I've been doing a bunch of stuff lots of different stuff kind of echoing the same thing.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
I help people communicate. I help people collaborate help people find each other.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000
I i've actually got a really strong line of narrative and story running through my weaving through all of that.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:34.000
So I think narrative and story are really important and And the only like, for instance, the only way that people people communicate is within stories, and and that's the only way they understand stuff, too.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
So you kind of need to squash things down into a story before it may make sense.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Anybody, or you can let them kind of discover a story around an artifact or something like that.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000
But then you get interesting, emergent things, but not communication.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
So So Wikis is a big part of that.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Helping people use tech is a big part of it i've I've i'm good at tech and a lot of people are good at making the world better and that that doesn't always overlap so I like to find

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:23.000
people who not so much, not so much I I actually like to look for people who are are underserved by by tech and who wants to do something, and I try to help them.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Do what they think is most important. So the way I say that is not people who are making the world better.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.000
But people have good intent, so I I like to help people of good Intent do the thing that they think is really important.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:47.000
So most recently with this network of folks and then a bunch of interlocking networks that are larger than that.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:57.000
The thing that i've been trying really hard to work on is decentralization and federation.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000
So helping people work together at scale without being very tightly bound to each other.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:19.000
So one of the projects that's that is in this intern network of networks is called the Meta Project and

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
I would have to say that this has been kind of a hard week.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:33.000
So part of the reason i'm always a little bit quiet and shy. but part of the reason i'm a little bit quiet and shy today is because it's been a hard week especially with meta project and I

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000
don't mean hard like bad I mean hard like a lot of work.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
And not a lot of not a lot of feeling ever warned yet.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:51.000
There's another wendy in our group wendy Alfred. and she and I spent a lot of time together.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
So yesterday we were together for 4Â h on one of our regular work work.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Sessions. we had about an hour of work to do, I think, and we did about half an hour of it, and so I have homework today.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:10.000
The other 3 and a half was working to like kind kind of a pretty minor detail about how people work together.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:22.000
So meta project right now his it's in bootstrap mode, and we're kind of trying to boot stop at at a couple of levels of hierarchy and scale at the same time, and and

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:38.000
It's really confusing for everybody and everybody's frustrated by it, and the the a main frustrating. Thank God, this is recorded. One of my homework things for Wendy Alfred is is to have some

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
short stories for her, so that she can the rest of you will understand this.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:54.000
So she's collecting up stories from a few of us so that she can sense makerize them, or lexie monster them into a visualization.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:01.000
See here's what we're talking about and why everybody's frustrated wendy alfred's a wizard at doing that.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:13.000
So So this is what I just went through parts of it, or a story that I can grab from the the transcript or something, and give to her. thank God because it's a hard alright homework project for me

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:22.000
anyway. it's it's i'm i'm kind of in a double mind.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Frustration. Hi! this is well. I feel a little bit weird having this on on a recording.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
But whatever is it? I have a because it doesn't actually really matter?

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
I have a like a personal frustration. that doesn't really matter in a large scale.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:53.000
So usually. I just don't talk about those much but I have this double buying frustration, because one of my whatever the actions and avatar takes are called I don't know how you would say that but one of one of

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:00.000
the things that I do for this community is run communication systems.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:14.000
And Wendy Wendy and I both finally ended up kind of like being able to talk about the same problems in a language we both Co.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Understood yesterday, after like an hour and a half or 2Â h and I said, it's kind of like we're trying to fit.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:30.000
I was talking about the meeting the Meta project meeting this this week. we're trying to fit Â£15 of of stuff into a Â£10 sack.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
And and really we had Â£25 of stuff that we had to fit somewhere, and we just threw away 10 of it.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:47.000
But then we still had this problem where and she said that's a great metaphor, Pete, and and what happens when you try to fit Â£15 of stuff and a Â£10 sack.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Is that it leaks out everywhere, kind of so i'm trying to trying to help shepherd everybody into a very small number of communication channels ideally kind of one and it's kind of exploded all over the

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000
place, and there's little conversations happening everywhere and which is fine.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:19.000
I think actually, there should be conversations everywhere, but we're having conversations that need to be in shared space in unshared spaces.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:29.000
So I I love that people have conversations outside. outside the shared spaces, but only the conversations need to be outside the shared spaces and the ones that need to be.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:38.000
So we we can't fit it into the Â£10 sock and everybody's frustrated about that.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:45.000
And and so all the stuff spilled out and no and and we can't even put it back right.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.000
And I guess you know, I said, you know this. We can make the sack bigger in certain ways, and we could put it back in.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000
But it's too messy all over the place and stuff like that So that's that's this week for me.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Fluttilla, but welcome to Flotella flotilla!

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:09.000
We work on The The original conceit was to work on tools for connectors.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:17.000
And part of that is directories. Part of that is is I I like a word called matchmakers and matchmaking.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:28.000
So one of the ways that people get connected, I think, is by humans being parts of different networks, and saying, Hey, you should just like Stacey did right for you, hey?

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
You should, and just like you're doing with the visualization that you've got, hey?

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:42.000
You should know this person right? You should know that person so I I really like that, and that's kind of in the dna of flotilla the other.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Another big part of the Dna of flotilla is blending people and technology.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:44:06.000
And then, and then making sure that the technology isn't single community single tech it's actually can fit together with many other kinds of technologies that are trying to do similar things.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
For you know, different different networks and things like that.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:15.000
So. So this is maybe a good home for you. , So thank you, Pete.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Thanks for sharing. Yeah, just what I got. There was

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Doing hard things could be frustrating and But yeah, kind of like finding the essence right of like what to do using that through everyone's share.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:56.000
And what i'm getting is and with like my project right is like, could we define people through like their their essence in a way like who they are, is maybe like as a possibility.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:16.000
And then like have that away capture of that you know and and have that as as to kind of I I like that, and I've I've also kind of got from from my background or my my dent or whatever my

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:27.000
my expectation is that the way that that works best is to have a platform, a space, however, you want to call it where people can express themselves.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:36.000
But then for it, the essence essentially to be recognized by other people and by by matchmakers.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:48.000
So i'm big on i'm i'm big on saying that I think the tools help you help help different humans.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Remember what's special about people help remember what's special about me.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Helping remember what special about you and help remember what's special about her, but that the actual like the So you can so that the the representation of the the essence is actually in other people's heads and the tools just help you remember that and

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000
I articulate it, and stuff like that. But the the essence part is actually an emergent property of other people.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Seeing you, and thinking about you, and and loving you, and stuff like that.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:28.000
So then, the way that you know the way that works together with people is that you say? hey?

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:51.000
I love this person I think you'll love this person and That's the that's the the match making part. That's the connection part that's how you can actually get the essences shown visible

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Michael, I think you're out

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Well, hello, i'm not only inspired by what you were doing to let you, but it's it's great to hear and Pete, and okay on introduce themselves.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:26.000
And you know for a long time there's a lot there's a lot of getting out of they're saying

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:33.000
There's a lot that overlaps with where i'm coming from

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:53.000
My my back. is in in media making I spent let's have 3 3 phases to my professional life.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:14.000
You know, if you take it pre pre person there's just like sort of being what I thought was an activist when I was like a little kid and Berkeley, California and and then you know, wanting to move, into some way to express that

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:21.000
and help other people. experience. address that which meant getting into public and stumbling into it.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.000
Out of that

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:35.000
The is helping other people effectively communicate what they have to say.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Spend a lot of time, you know. messages organizing their inference information up with signage.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Ways to help them help them. the scene and expressed and usually it's writer, the photographer, the illustrator, who like presenting is the person who's message is important my importance is is making

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:22.000
sure that comes through not, you know, layering my message on top of that like out of a long career.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:36.000
And and the magazine major I sort of moved into digital expression of those kind of legacy business work done.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Okay, How is

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Time, man or first, or this publication or that, you know how, how is, how is this publication going?

00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:04.000
The manifest itself and digital space. And it was incredibly frustrating because it was hard to those businesses see that they need

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Just look at what they were doing. This was in different ways than oh, we this!

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:32.000
How does that same express the digital way like let's take these articles that we on the world Wide web as opposed to this is who we are?

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.000
How do we be in this new space? that might have nothing to do do with articles?

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:56.000
It's like if we came up with the idea of being time, You know what would time be if it wasn't already a magazine digital space which, by

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:10.000
And out of out of that frustration I got into what i'm doing now

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Platform called Factor

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:29.000
And it's a thanks pete that's that to be that

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:36.000
And actually, if you are logging into that

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Google. O often not work too

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:49.000
So I have to double check

00:51:49.000 --> 00:52:08.000
And it's about a whole lot of things that that we're all thinking about right now, and that is that you know information provenance for people has gotten really mupped up it's really you know it's great thing that you know

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:19.000
that's compared to the previous life. of of content publishing that creation is democratized and everybody can do it.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:26.000
But there's a big problem with that which is now, it's democratized, and everything to do it

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:43.000
And and also the you know thenership of algorithms is is distorting the information that's been out there and promoting stuff that's can send the area.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:51.000
And then aging, and all that stuff. So how do we?

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.000
You know. Take

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:10.000
You know, take control of what information it is that we choose to see, and not distracted by stuff that we don't really want. I want to see, but is can make our diet what we choose.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:19.000
It's healthy, not candy and treats and fatty stuff that somebody should shoving at us.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:39.000
I mean there's lots of lots of metaphors I love to get into there, but i'll i'll stop myself And And then, on the other hand, how do we take what we have and selectedly present the world control

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:48.000
to say, You know this information is mine and protected for me.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:55.000
This is, if I want to share with group right here. This is stuff I want to share with my family.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:03.000
This is what I want to share these professional peers. The swift project with Doctor.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:23.000
This with my accountant whatever there's all different layers of access. and we want to be able to control And you know that project is something that I'm fully cognizant.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:33.000
That you know the only one working on, and there are many of us, and and we a lot of us here are, are, you know, really concerned with those same?

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:40.000
They overlap. So you know, I spend a lot of my time in groups.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Just kind of industry for lack of a better term. groups.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:55:03.000
That are about ethnic, ethical tech and information sharing no anti disinformation, digital privacy.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:19.000
And My frustration is that in capitalist. world we're all coming from this sort of Oh, how do I get my piece of the pie?

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:31.000
I you know, factor, I co-founded it with someone else, and it was founded as for profit, and i'm really frustrated by that.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:50.000
I don't I don't want to see venture capital I'm like for ways to merge what I'm doing with what other people are doing, and the the legal frameworks and the economic conditions for that are almost you

00:55:50.000 --> 00:56:00.000
know a brick wall, but i'm sure there's a way through it, determined to find it so of a ramble.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:09.000
But a little bit of a funding of where i'm sending some, and you know i'm just really excited about you know.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:17.000
I'm here and flotilla and Better project, and no individually working with a lot of people here.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:35.000
And a lot of people who aren't here trying to connect us all and make individuals more more equal not living in somebody else's shopping mall.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:42.000
But you know both safe at home and able to public space that's truly.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Probably like,

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:53.000
That's all

00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Thank you mind for sharing I know we're

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:13.000
Vincent: my turn. Okay, So let's see I try to keep this sort of short.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:27.000
Yeah, my background is in the intersection of engineering and design. And And so went to an engineering school called Rpi, and I wanted to initially like solve problems.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:32.000
And engineers are great at solving problems. so I was like Okay, cool.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:45.000
I'll create like robotic submarine systems and solve the world's greatest problems. And then, through like kind of going through the initial engineering courses. I realized like yeah like engineers are really great at solving problems.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:53.000
But they don't necessarily get to choose which problems are worth solving, or which are the like important problems to solve.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:58:02.000
And so that's kind of how I got into design and design thinking, and I did a dual program with this did be.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:12.000
It was in the social sciences, and it was about like how to look at technology and think about what could be the unintended consequences.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:23.000
How do we use design in order to shape technology in a way that have more ethical outcomes that are it's more equitable for people on the planet?

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:40.000
And Yeah. So through that I kind of was like in me is like very pro tech, and the other half of me is like against tech and very like trying to make sure it's designed to create more positive impacts than negative effects and and

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:51.000
externalities. So yeah. And and through through that I ended up the spring that I really love connecting people.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:59:01.000
And I kept seeing the same problems over and over again, in like every single group chat that I was in Great Club, the part of

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:07.000
There would be this kind of like falling out where people would lose touch, and then not have an easy way to reconnect.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:19.000
And so I think a club called ties. and it was a group of like human matchmakers on college campus that basically the people connect with.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:27.000
They're looking for. so we ended up hosting different events and

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:34.000
We had a directory of people working on startups and when people would come to us and be like, hey? i'm looking to work on a startup. we could like match bake.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:42.000
And so i'm really interested in How we can kind of use technology to help awesome. do that at scale.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:55.000
Because yet I experience firsthand like some of my roommates like working on the same exact problem like a desalination system where there was someone else on a campus of like, you know, a 1,000 people working on the same exact issue and They

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:10.000
didn't know about each other and so that was kind of the initial inspiration for the work i'm doing now with catalyst, which is a between a social network and a digital library.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
So it's all about like cataloging information and tagging it.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:23.000
It's it's very structured and organized so it's, like, you know, a really intricate library system of like knowing where things go.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:32.000
So that way you and either with a human matchmaker or in an automated way, connect people with what they're looking for when they need it.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:50.000
And so instead of kind of like re creating chat systems and like notification systems like the other piece that I started working on was like how to integrate with other technologies such as discord telegram matter most that have these like

01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:01.000
streams, or even like a zoom chat where this like stream of information, and instead of like having another stream like, how can we take information from that and organize it?

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Add some level of structure to it to make it easier to find later.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:21.000
And so that's kind of where the catabot project comes in which is connected and so been just trying to do the mash-making and the connecting in a way that also doesn't overwhelm us

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:31.000
with even more information, and even more feeds so it's kind of like, How can you given that we already have all these feeds and and ways, and place that people are sharing?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:41.000
How can we organize that information where we can connect it to people when they need it?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Yeah, i'm thinking about that. for my my work at 4 mile where we just wanna like capture knowledge, and we're all working on slack a lot of Oh, that knowledge is captured there and how do we extract it

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Yeah, in a way that right? Okay, this particular approach to a problem has been done before.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:14.000
But it's like here, and the slack right yeah thinking about how to kind of memorialize it in a way that's accessible.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Awesome man, I am inspired. I Okay, I see what you guys are up to.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I'm present Now so this i'm i'm enrolled I what's next?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I know. I have to job by Mike for a call.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
But I you want to be involved in some form of yeah.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.000
So we I just like i'll join next week i'm Sorry to kind of take over the call.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I don't know how long you guys are actually on the call actually

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I'm so glad you came and I just want to say to all of you.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I'm so grateful to have all of you and I appreciate you so much, and like my heart is so full when I leave here.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:11.000
And Pete. This was a really hard week you're I mean I think a lot of us have felt that you know.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Maybe i'm wrong, but I I do think a lot of us have felt that.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:26.000
And so I just wanna tell you that I really love you all I and I mean that i'm not known to get away compliments when I don't mean them so.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And thank you Collette, you for coming i'm I'm so happy that you were that you came thank you, Clutchy.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:42.000
I really hope for you again. Yeah, i'll be here next week. Yeah, 90Â min. right?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Alrighty I have to drop but thank you guys for sharing and excited for what's next.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:01.000
And before we get off we will have to get back to what we were talking about, which was our in-person.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Get together,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Yeah, that would be really nice. yeah, Where? When will that be?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I dot com, but curious. yeah, maybe we could start up at something and matter most too like just to try to the New York Channel, the New York News Channel.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:45.000
And then , invite even honorary new yorkers like see even there mark enough i'd love to be a 100 New Yorker.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:55.000
It's certainly easier for me to go there than west coast

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I I would love to bring the conversation back around to the stuff that's happened for you guys in matter most this week, you know.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:15.000
If there's support, I feel like because I was on vacation last week, I got out of the loops, but I'm happy to listen and and be present or provide support or you know just I i'm I would love to hold

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:22.000
space for that, Wherever that needs to go if that's a service, you guys did a lot of work in the last couple of weeks, and I know how hard that is.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I've been in those spaces too, within matter most I mean we've all been in those spaces before.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I mean i'm sorry with a meta and so just ha happy to happy to hold space for that

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
One of the challenges is that jordan's turns a little bit out.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Actually a lot out. he shouldn't be doing anything with us but he's with the the in laws spending time with the family.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:58.000
So so that's kind of exacerbated a little bit

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Sorry, are you? What are did I hear that you were working on?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Interrupt, among other things right now. who are you asking you mostly?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:21.000
But I I nothing. Well, yeah, nothing new. interrupt architecture and stuff like that.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:38.000
The the thing that I I have been working on is my little corner of decentralization, which I think, was well during, and I are still working through it.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:47.000
But we're doing it very asynchronously so my my part is a little bit smaller than what Jordan was thinking, and they fit together.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But drawing the line of where drawing the edge so maybe it's talking about ed nor bates and and edges. yesterday.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Anyway. nothing super new. Been reading a lot on new models of C.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.000
R. Dts. and how to do convergence and how to do this, and how to do that.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:23.000
It's been awesome It's there's been new papers like Martin Lutherman. I could do a review of those if you're interested.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:43.000
It's probably probably, unfortunately, not for me. but Ccr Dt is is how people have worked out technology so that you can do 2 things more than one person can do.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Kind of the same thing in the same place. So a classic example is Google Docs, or how come D where bunch of people can type together and everybody can see the changes in real time.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Stay stay here muted. So C. stands for collaboration for conflict.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Free , , replicate data types data.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Oh, thank you. conflict conflict free replicated data types is the Cr: Dt: perfect? Yeah, it's conflictfully or convergent.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:28.000
You may be right. which so there's a whole topic right there.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Is a concept for you, or conversion. or they leave out the f conflict free cause it's dash lowercase half so my my old, my old thing I I was on team ot operational transform for the longest

01:08:45.000 --> 01:09:00.000
time. not because I believe in not I so Oh, ticking before right I wasn't on teamot until came around i'm on team ot, just because just of gentle is was he was like the main ot person, and

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:08.000
he did . amazing work. Good question: Who links these team names?

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Those are team names there aren't those weren't team names. Just so gentle or maybe somebody right before him said, I have this new algorithm I will call it operational transfer, and there's it it makes sense

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:29.000
why you call it operational transform so then somebody else I think in parallel.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
I don't think they were working off each other but somebody else said,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.000
We need a way to have data change in multiple places at once, but not create conflicts.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
It needs to so i've i've created this conflict it's replicated.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:52.000
It's conflict free data types. they're they're really basic, no, not not brand names at all but teams name themselves basically.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Well, it's it's it's barely a project. it's it's just algorithms.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:04.000
It's algorithms, and but you both identified yourself as being on a team.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
No, no, Emoji they were.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.000
They were different separate algorithms for doing the same thing. and and it blew my mind.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Joseph Gentle is this wonderful Australian guy, and you know him, You would think he was a surfer dude, you know.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:30.000
But he also did this amazing I so marcentuan is probably smart enough to understand. crts and ots and stuff like that.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I just Can't you know I start looking at the math I I don't have enough mouth There's a whole interesting story about me and math.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I I have i'm really good at math but it's all intuitive.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000
I don't actually understand any of it really I can just feel it separately.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000
My my oldest kid, my daughter she's actually a math a genius.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:11:02.000
She's a whiz and you know she can look at math, and she thinks it's she and I are both good at languages in different ways, and she's like Oh, mouth is just another language and I get it but

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:09.000
anyway, so I never, I never, understood ot it but It's it's like magic, you know.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:20.000
You like drag and and Joseph gentle used to write these couple of 100 lines of javascript type skip coffee, script code and and it's like here all you have to do is this and and imagine

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:28.000
you're doing this like conflict free you know replicated stuff, and it's like how does that even work?

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I I guess you know the if you don't think about it. it's It's just like if you don't think about Google docs and the fact that people are typing together.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
It's like, Yeah, Okay, I get it you know it's more tax the the techies invented some stuff.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000
It's actually really really hard. and i've read enough of the mouth. And I've read enough diagrams and stuff like that, You know.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:54.000
It's like Okay, this person changed you know this this character and there's 3 other people and that person changed that character.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000
And how do you make sure that all of that data flows around that network?

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And everybody ends up seeing the same thing right and and not like, because the letters are coming out of order at different times in different ways, and people hitting backspace and all that kind of stuff, all of that stuff is happening and making sure that

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
everybody sees the same thing is like mind blowingly difficult.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
So so ot was magic. Just a gentle was, you know.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I got to see him a couple of times i'm like Wow!

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:33.000
This is so cool and I love that there's this person in the world. And then i'm hearing this thing about Crdt and i'm like you know those Jessica is the the genius here I don't know

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Why, why, even anybody even bothered inventing anything. So the mind-blowing thing, was like 5 or 10 years later, Joseph Gentles.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
He posted something on Twitter and blew my line.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:51.000
He said, Okay, Crdt is actually the right way to do it. There's like little Tiny like you know, plus and minuses between them that make you know.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Make it so that ot is not perfect, like I thought it was.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:03.000
See Rdt is actually much more close to perfect than ot, you know, down in the like, like in decimal place.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:09.000
So like blew my mind when joseph like to me went over to the dark side right and it turns out.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Oh, no, I guess that's the light side I was I was wrong this whole time.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.000
So the I I was very much thinking, they're not neither is that complicated.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:29.000
By the way, I mean, I understand reading the math. No, understand. Reading the maths can be complicated, but the idea behind them is not t , Yeah.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
I get intimidated by now fair enough to do the reading.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.000
The math. Is not that easy? but ot and crt are not that hard?

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
And for me it's like what's the problem with with ot because it works.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
But yeah, I did read. I just posted joseph's I was wrong.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Crdts are the future, and and and I think I see why.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And it's and it does show how kudos to Joseph Gentle for having the modesty of saying, Yeah, I got it wrong.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:14.000
It reminds me of this frigate and Russell right. it's this kind of intellectual humility.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I was on the wrong track, and I think that's true but and Martin Cliffman's work is also luminous.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:37.000
It's so clear it's so it just works and I've actually started playing with auto merge, which is one of clipments and implementations of cr dt beautiful work, and yeah if you're interested in

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000
multi-editor and multi many people, modifying something at once.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:52.000
This is where it go it's going but the other basic principle before that it's something that was happening with calm and bloom.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I don't know if you remember don't speak I think the ring is Well, yeah, Bloom bloom as a project didn't go anywhere but the ideas behind bloom are again.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Extremely luminous and clear. and, a lot of those ideas in the in the newest equipment, theoretical incarnation which is upsets by the way upsets is the new shiny thing in that

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:32.000
world. and I think it's extremely important even if you're not thinking of real-time.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:47.000
If you're thinking of i'm doing something in my side You're doing something on your side, and we want to combine them and see what's the common view of this this is where Popsets or bloom or all these

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:56.000
approaches are relevant to the notion. of we want to combine information for for for everybody else.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Sorry we're peking out here. but but it is actually not just Google Docs, or how comed and characters it.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:12.000
The it's a general purpose thing for databases will you know, even even H.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:28.000
One of Joseph jentle's early Demos was being able to change things like drag and drop list items in a web page and multiple people could do that at the same time and you know the list stayed in

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Sync. So it's kind of the same thing with databases.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.000
And the other thing is like like Mark and twon said it's not just real real time.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000
It. it's also offline works really well so back in San Francisco.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.000
It was the the Bart Tunnel between the under the bay that goes from San Francisco to Berkeley.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:17:01.000
It's like you wanna be able to like start clouding with somebody on a text document, and then take the tunnel over to Berkeley, and you know, with back in the day we Didn't have any Internet in the

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
tunnel, and so you pop up in Berkeley, and magically.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Your text editor shows the same thing that somebody else was typing the whole time on.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.000
So so it can actually be. you know it can be like 5 or 10Â min.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:26.000
It can be like days or weeks, and maybe paragraphs have moved around and things like that, and you're still able to reconciled It's not a trivial problem But but again it's

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:36.000
reconciling role views again. it's the same problem we keep talking about whether it's the real-time aspect is incidental up to a point to it being the fundamental problem.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000
We're all dealing with that's Why i'm deep in the Cr.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Dt world these days

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:54.000
It. It has relationships also to get get kind of does the same thing with human help a little bit, and not not much human help, but a little bit.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:01.000
And then hyper knowledge is something where you'd want different people I it in a way it's kind of the same thing.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Hyper Knowledge is a way for for people to layer changes on top of knowledge structures and keep them all in sync kind of It's a weird way to say that.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:20.000
But yes, just take 2 Sorry, Vincent.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:37.000
This seems like a really like obvious thing. but to any companies just use Wiki instead of email, and then have some notification setup. where, like you make a Wiki page, or any it just sends I I think there are a

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000
few companies that do that mostly. not social tax with the the company around.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.000
That did enterprise, Wikis. Our Our company was exactly like that.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:19:06.000
It turns out you also need chat. So we replaced at yeah. At the time the Enterprise suite was outlook and and powerpoint and word and sharepoint, and whatever share drive was before sharepoint

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:11.000
and so we we didn't use email and we didn't use presentations.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
We just had the wiki, so we had a wiki.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:26.000
But then you also needed chat, which in our time was irc, which is slack, is basically irc made nice. And madamos is basically slack.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:44.000
And you know so everything is just interesting we've defaulted to have tools which embody which like we're like attaching files within instead of like file, tools that the chat goes on top of

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
It's very interesting if that's the default and I'm.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Sure Gary would be like that chat is wonderful.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I don't want to say chat is but the problem is, you need to have the 2 modes you need to have the the flow, and you need to have the stock.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:10.000
You need to have the cost, and then you need to build something lasting. That is, not just in the moment.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.000
But you need both. it's true you can't always be editing a document that's a fact.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:30.000
But you can't if you're just doing chat at some point reaching back in history to know anything that was said is a stupid way to curate knowledge

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:36.000
And so you need to transform the flow into stock that's what idle loon was about.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
But I knew there was more web forums than chat, because it was before Slack had caught up so much.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.000
So we thought, you know, there'll be kind of fast stuff on chat because we were.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:21:07.000
We were using chat jabber while developing we thought there would be a kind of mid range speed conversation, web forum style, and the long term ideals would curate the conversation into this outline didn't happen because getting people

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:15.000
to shift to another web forum tool is hard, which we knew, so that you know, we put.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000
We tried to put hooks into, we could hook into mail, which some people still use.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:33.000
So that works or into Facebook and then Facebook changes change the Api too fast for us to follow, because they don't really want people to get anything out of Facebook that's not in their interest.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:45.000
It's. Their whole interest is the wild garden and the whole question of how, as you were saying, Michael, earlier, how to have something that is interoperable.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Yet the aware of privacy. And who do I want to share this with is an absolutely fundamental problem.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:03.000
I was just gonna I I I misunderstood you, and in a in a serendipitous way.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I thought you said Wild Garden instead of Wald Garden, and and you know , Why, your garden?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Well, no, I mean I I the the fact that that Facebook is not only a walled garden, but a wild garden in a sense that it's impossible to find anything is to their advantage.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:43.000
They want you to be in their world garden, and just wandering around aimlessly and distractably, it amazes

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Yeah, another interesting that that vincent observed there is that So you've got this.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
The however you want, call it stocks and flows, or chats and files.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Chat messages and files the we we end up in systems that conceptual, I conceptually our chat systems with file attachments rather than file systems with messaging. and and I think I my pop psychology interpretation of that

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:30.000
is that is having having spent a fair amount of time trying to sell my enterprise wiki, and being successful largely to to companies and and people who just want to get stuff done and don't wanna play around the tech

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:36.000
you can chat. Seems like a first class. object to almost everybody.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Whereas files are first class object to not many people.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:59.000
So when you explain to to somebody you know I the the chat system with file file features is going to be acceptable to a lot more people kind of just says, Oh, it's yeah, obviously I need to send messages to that

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:08.000
person, and it would be great if I get to that files most people don't go around and going look at all the files I have, and you know that's the thing I really care about and hey?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.000
If I could message a person about this file that would be awesome that's It's just not I you know.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:28.000
That's not the way people work so I think it's There's a there's a kind of a fake saying, you know, everything everything available until it it has a chat system or something like that I forget

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:35.000
the wouldn't you call the common system in Google Doc a bit of a chat system.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:44.000
No, a bit. Yeah. Well, I would point to social, particularly Facebook.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:25:10.000
As a sort of midway model that has not been allowed to flourish in a press practical way, which is, you know, between chat between files being the primary object and chat being the thing is the post comments which serve

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:18.000
as chat and the post might be statement, a question, a file whatever.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:33.000
But the fact that you have a conversation that is attached to an object rather than an object that's embedded in a conversation is great, and Everybody's, you know, comfortable with that experiences that all the time on Facebook and

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Instagram, and you know any social social space like that?

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:55.000
And that to me is is like something I mean worked with that a little bit on factor, something, and then able to like comment under it.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And if if slack, I I feel like there's there's some sweet spot there like both things have to exist in the sense that, unlike Facebook, you need to be like lightning searchable to say Now, I want to see like all the stuff

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:28.000
on this subject that is, you know, a video or whatever which Facebook doesn't want you to do because they don't want you to get directly there, and then jump into the asynchronous conversation about that thing not have it having

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:40.000
disappeared up the slack matter most whatever you know chat river I think there's I think there's something.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:49.000
This is the reddit. niche. right if the thing exists on the open web. You can have a reddit conversation around it, and and it works really well.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty good. I mean reddit is a little bit to me.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:06.000
A reddit is a little bit more the object, and embedded in the conversation because, like a reddit yeah.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:13.000
A subreddit you can't really find the object it's not it's not object primary it's forum primary.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I mean it's like the conversation. if you consider the forum a conversation, I mean, I think you're seeing that model, as this is a discussion under one object which is the subject which is yeah which is which is often a

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Url of a document on the web, sure and that way that the primary.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.000
You have a primary document on the web, and then you have the conversation around it, are you?

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:47.000
But are you talking about an entire subreddit or Somebody's individual post within that subreddit?

01:27:47.000 --> 01:28:17.000
That is a url based on the url of something else, say it's an example of the of the I hate to use Facebook as a model for anything but that that Facebook model. is that the unless an entire subred is built around a

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Url. What you tend to get is a subreddit that is a subject that ends up being the Forum.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:35.000
As a conversation within which somebody will post a url and they'll be a little bit of discussion of that. but it sort of ends up working a little bit like slack.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:46.000
I mean it's better than slack, but but yeah, I don't know another conversation.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I was wondering if we might want to circle back to to some of the stuff about general.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I mean it's related. to this but that's going on in in no, no, we all did.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I mean, you know we were doing the to let you talk, and then you know it was I, I ended up.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:16.000
I spoke over Wendy, and then she didn't get to talk. that was wondering what she was gonna say, and she remembers.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Sure. yeah, and i'm happy to go back to that after this year I was just gonna throw in that Maybe some of this has what we're talking about in terms of the difference between chat and the comments on documents and

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:36.000
documents themselves was speaking to me. I never really thought about it before, and it was in terms of why people are doing what they're doing.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:44.000
And I was thinking to me in terms more in terms of sense making like, So if i'm chatting there's a little more of like, I can just throw thought that thoughts out depends on the forum.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000
But yeah, I can get. I can throw thoughts out If somebody replies to great, If not, that's fine.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I'm like throwing my thoughts There I don't necessarily need to reflect on them as much.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:00.000
If i'm making a comment on a document i'm reflecting on something in the document i'm trying to add to it, or I'm trying to I'm.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Trying to bring it forward by commenting on it right and so I'm taking it's like in a meeting. I'm taking there.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:15.000
There's times when we share things and then the conversation was on fine. That's more chat like in the argument. I'm making here versus the time when i'm sharing something.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:25.000
And then someone else goes. Oh, I want to add on to that right there's there's something different that's happening when we're when we're making efforts to connect what we're saying to each other then just a bunch

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:34.000
of information data points thrown into the middle, and then the document itself starts to be an artifact that can change for a while.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:41.000
That probably would change for a while, and then eventually it falls off and stops being changed so much the as we're having conversations.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Somebody Somebody is sense making it into a document or into an artifact that then can serve over time.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
There's very few people are gonna go through a chat and make sense out of it.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:31:03.000
It it it's it's more in the moment right versus a document which is hopefully now curated to the point since made to the point where someone else could read it, and get some knowledge out of it.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.000
So that's I was starting to realize in terms of a sense making continuum hadn't really thought about it before.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.000
So to your point. Yeah, like make sense to me when I think about it that way, like chats available to everybody. just.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I had this thought here's my thoughts here's my thoughts here's my thoughts here's my thoughts here's my thoughts.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.000
It's moving from that to something else, and and and instead as a society.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:32.000
We've actually moved more towards the chat chat you know, and maybe some of that's because of that gets ads, and it's easy, and it's right like so from a tech perspective.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:37.000
And from the way our capitalist society set up it also serves the system.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:45.000
But it's, you know be nice to move move things in the other direction, too, and I do think all all the parts are are important as well, you know.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:53.000
So I think they all have a role. to play. but putting it in that for me, putting it in that context of sense making was helping me put it in its lanes.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:01.000
No it's it's it's absolutely important the It's all the issue of sets making through time right.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:07.000
The chat is the immediate reactions necessary we need to you know sense and react.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:14.000
That's one temporality. The document is crystallized the result of a crystallized stock process.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:24.000
It's curated, but the problem, is it's usually curated by one or very few people, because collaboration is hard, and it becomes harder as you add people.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:38.000
So it's single or not that many points of view and and as you see, it stops evolving, and in a way it's a good thing, because if it keeps evolving, it loses coherence and that's

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:46.000
a problem with Wikipedia Wiki pages, coherent as you evolve them, is even harder.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:53.000
So what you either you have successive sense making articles maybe by different people.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000
And but then it's like okay? what's the sense of history?

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:02.000
And how does the later version connect to the earlier version? Yet I get it out.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:12.000
How do multiple versions talk together and that's the part that i'm most interested in.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:20.000
But the the whole question of you have created the document at some point. you have to revisit it.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:26.000
You. You see, you know, we took decisions. We made predictions.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000
We made sense making a certain way, and then new fax come and we tried things a certain way.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:38.000
It worked. It didn't work lessons learned we have to revisit without this destroying the historical information.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
The document, because this is the best we could do with that information.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:49.000
At that time, and we want to know to keep, knowing that having that kind of information leads to this kind of decision.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:34:08.000
But, by the way, now, with new information, we get a different decision that's , Now I want to go back to Michael, who wanted to move on to Meta stuff

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:20.000
I was just commenting on wiki Chat Post object interface, I have a quick thing.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Maybe I can fit into the just this here, which is I? the the the thing I posted Jamie Z.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Lewinsky, it said. You know, everything involves into email basically into an email client.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And then Luke W. said everything evolves into a chat system.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:45.000
There's there's something there those are connections to but but then I remember that jade Jamie is only he does these amazing rounds.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
So I have one, or 2, collected and I can't find them right now.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000
So I was looking for Rance, and I found this one about kill math.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:35:01.000
It's by the by the way the other funny thing is in high school.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000
I was considered a math genius like like Oh, my God!

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:12.000
You know and literally I was number 11 I placed number 11 in the State competition for for math.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:19.000
It's a small state I was in nevada big geographic state, small population. but anyway, so then I went to Caltech, where they actually do math.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.000
And it. The other thing is as a as a high school student I didn't.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
They didn't have enough math so I had to go to the University of Nevada.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Reno, where I was in like a junior level class, and blue the curve for a bunch of med students, you know.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:46.000
And so when I say that I i'm not good at math, it's a weird thing right, because most people think I would be really good at math. But anyway, I went to caltech where they really do math and down like within like

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:51.000
a day. It was okay, Pete, you're in remedial mouth 0 dot 9. literally.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:56.000
That was what it was called. I didn't get to go with to math one like everybody else, you know.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000
So it worked out great because we had a great, a wonderful ta who spent a lot of time with us.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
And you know I got to learn about differential equations or whatever.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:19.000
But but anyway, so I found this round in my collection of rants, and it's really good, and it's not so much about math as much as visualization and representing data and stuff in in a way in in

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:31.000
a lot often visual ways. so I I felt like that was a worthy thing to drag back into our space, because I just skimming over that long blog post.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I think there's a lot of articulation about stuff that we care about

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I never did get good at mouth at Caltech. I was really good at physics, because physics, and is kind of intuitively mouth.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:57.000
But the mouth part I just was over again. I did not like geometric proofs, although I had in in ninth and tenth grade in high school.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:08.000
We had a algebra and ge geometry. teacher who brutalized the the children, and and I didn't know that at the time I just thought she was a little weird.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.000
But she had very little patience for for high schoolers

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:20.000
And so she would run through stuff and and if you didn't get it.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
She had no pity on you, and she boot lies.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:37.000
People really. So there was a young lady who never got the the concept of an invisible one in front of a like, you know, if you have x plus y, it's like 2 x plus twoy made sense. to her but if you take away

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000
the number. So there's no number she never got the concept that there's an invisible one there.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Right. So she ended up being called. The teacher called her Invisible one.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Because you know she never got it. There was another one that. so I I took geometry from her, and I think I got spoiled from about about the whole geometric stuff in general, because of her

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:05.000
The The poor person that she utilized in geometry was Albert

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
So we learned the angle angle, side angle angle.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:21.000
You know side whatever. and then side side angle and then there's angle side side, which spells ask which you're supposed to think of that as the as the one that doesn't work right it doesn't have

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:28.000
enough of the right components to make it work. So Albert never got that one, and because his name was Albert

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Ass became. Albert says so, you know Albert says so that this is is proper.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:39.000
So the other funny thing about her was she kept the room at like 65 degrees to keep us all at attention.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:46.000
You know everybody's like feeding the death the whole time Anyway, I really liked her.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:56.000
If she left me alone. but I didn't realize until later that she was horrible teacher,

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000
So I don't even know about geometry I I got you know.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.000
I I like hid I didn't want to get pete pizza, so about something.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:12.000
So sorry. Anyway, I think that blog post is interesting.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000
And it might be worth a look, and especially maybe for Vincent too.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Or our folks doing mapping maps and visualizations and stuff which which post the kill math one?

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Yes, it's so it it's gotta catch you title kill mouth, and and it makes it sound like I hate mouth, but I don't.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:47.000
But it. But whatever it's like, really about map it's more about visualization, and you know geometric geometric things, and how to show those to people so apologies for the digression for people who are visual and and

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:53.000
and I thought totally value that but i'm not visual I'm.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:00.000
A Matt as logic person. I these these visual things don't help me, which is fine.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I mean I I have to ask. I I wanted to ask, and then I talk myself out. but I have to ask, especially because you kind of give me an opening.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
So it turns out that i'm i'm also a really good scholar.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Not because i'm smart which is what everybody thought you know when I was in school.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:23.000
It's because I have visual memory for words which sounds like a really weird thing to me.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000
But I have it, and one of my daughters have it.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:35.000
And we did not know this at all until we were driving in the car, and my my wife said, How do you spell and long, complicated word?

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Right, and my daughter and I both tied up and it's like you know you just roule it off, and she's like, how do you guys do that?

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:48.000
And both of us said, Well, you just close your eyes and you read it off right, of course, .

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000
And my wife is like no that's not a thing you you know.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:05.000
So I wonder I wonder how you guys all complicated , and if that's set, I have to think of writing it. I'm a visual person.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:11.000
But yeah, I I I don't have a visual acuity for for for spelling.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
I'm i'm a horrible speller horrible speller.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000
So for spell check curious I'm really curious about that.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:29.000
I feel like those muscles of atrophy, but I mean I was always a really good speller, you know, like I won spelling bees when I was like a kid in school.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:41.000
But and i'm a visual person but I don't think I don't think I picture the whole word I mean.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:47.000
I know where it looks wrong when it's not held right but it's pattern recognition.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Yeah it's different I don't know i'm in the cute little non visual person.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.000
I'm very comfortable with spelling but it's not visual.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I had a friend who was one of the most visual person I knew.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Amazing painter, and she told she was telling me how in exams, she would visualize the page from the textbook and read that in her mind while answering questions.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:26.000
I really from me what it is is i'm such an associative thinker that i'm building maps in my head, and words don't fit into that mapping just like facts for me or names for me

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:37.000
don't fit into the mapping unless there's some sort of story around the name that makes same same same same. right? So for me that it's not really a visual thing versus a non visual thing it's more

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.000
of a of a fact like facts and dates rather rather than systems things.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:48.000
I'm just not a fax and dates person no, it's just it has to be a system.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:43:03.000
If It's not a system I like I was so good at remembering biology a lot of biology because it was systems like this. this is used for that, except the names of bones and names of muscles.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Yeah. but I remember I used to know the names of every single brain part, because, of course, I was more interested.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:15.000
But I knew what it was for. Yeah, right. putting it in the context. Yeah.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Makes all the difference for me, too. Yeah, but anyway, sorry we're really drifting.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:39.000
But it's interesting the the right

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:52.000
This one I remember remember also, like having visual like, I have these mind maps of things that had no there.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:59.000
There was no basis for my mind map. it's just the way. I drew the relationships and the distances in my head like when I was a little kid.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I was into, you know, comic books, and when I pictured the various titles and characters and the marvel, Universe and Dc.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Universe. I can still remember, like you know, Spider-man is here, and fantastic.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.000
4 is there, and dared toil is over here. and avengers are there, and X men is, you know.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:26.000
I mean it's like every everything was in a place and it was very specific, and it was the same way with like car companies.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:33.000
And you know you know Chrysler Ford, you know Gm.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
And subbrands, and where they all fit in this kind of tree.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:41.000
This map. What were the basis of those locations? I have no idea.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:51.000
But that was the only way I could like go through that those bits of knowledge and get to the sub components was in that map which I've never written down.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:45:03.000
But a can still see in my head it's your mind

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Yeah, my daughter's fabulous with all of that and she's good with remembering facts and names so it's like it's incredible she's like a whole she's a walking encyclopedia kind of

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:20.000
person. it's really fascinating to watch to have a front row seat as a parent to watch someone like develop has really been fun.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:26.000
I've learned a lot

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Meta project. Yeah, I mean pete I don't know if if you were exactly referring to this or and I know we back channeled a little bit in the in the meta meeting about the skills and

01:45:52.000 --> 01:46:20.000
passions. Google Doc. That, you know, was the kind of low hanging fruit output of our our waterfall in in a previous meeting, and led to both in the the last skills passions meeting which is funny, because I mean both of these

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:32.000
things wendy i've seen some of the the matter most conversation, and in the in the previous conversations about this group it's like, Why did this group spring into existence at the time that you were on vacation and you

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:57.000
didn't like sign up for it or anything which you would have but it's like totally tapestry related and we've gotten into all these questions of like what is what is the relationship between everything each of us are doing and everybody

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:03.000
else is doing, and the most basic manifestation of like.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Here I am. I am me participating in the Meta project, like How do I get to know my fellow members and figure out how we might collaborate?

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:21.000
And And how does that intersect with the needs that the Meta project has?

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:30.000
You know we're representing it in a bunch of different ways, and like honestly, I don't even mean to be representing it.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:40.000
All i'm Like into into is the idea that like anybody should be able to.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:49.000
I mean like to me. Google sheets is too complex, let alone, you know.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Pair table tapestry, massive wiki catalyst, You know.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:15.000
You know anything, you know, Factor. And how how do we make it possible for people to show up with a name, tag and work from there?

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:34.000
And and I I mean I think it's it's sort of the her, you know, problem in information so sharing and ethical, tech, and you know all the stuff that we were talking about before is like we all want to have an

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.000
identity, and you know, and and be safe in our own identity.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:45.000
And the privacy and agency that go with like me.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:53.000
And then we all wanna collaborate and connect, and just first of all be able to show up the way.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:08.000
We could show up to a space full of strangers and say here's a representation of me, and I don't have to already have joined the group and subscribe to something else.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:16.000
To be able to have my representation that exists in their centralized way.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Not my decentralized self and like it it's it's paralleling this debate on decentralization, and it it's I I see tensions developing around it, and I like have heart a hard

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:46.000
time discussing it. and I I don't want it to be about like spreadsheet versus not spreadsheet, because I don't care.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I mean, you know I, What I really want is just like, you know, people to show up with the augmented reality of being more than a box on a zoom screen.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:07.000
And you know this hovering thing that says Hi i'm willing to share this much with these people.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:13.000
You know i'm this is what i'm about and this is where I am or no.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:22.000
I don't want to tell you where I am and you know whatever it is, and how that be like easy and automatic.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:36.000
And and all around me i'm seeing like Oh, i've got the solution for that, or you know I've got the solution for that.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:49.000
I've got the solution, for that and i'm working at it. I'm gonna make it all make sense and I feel like, And this is this is, you know, I I know this is getting like theoretical.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:51:05.000
And impractical and stuff. But it's like I keep going back to this thought, and we've talked about this since Latin before, and you know I have, with various of you you know, the idea of the home that I am you know my

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:19.000
home, and I, like, you know, 10 be found and find you based on our willingness to share our address.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000
And you know, and you can always drop something in my mailbox.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000
I can't stop you from doing that and you can always see the outside of my house.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:34.000
But maybe i'll invite you into my living room and maybe i'll invite you into you know more in spaces, but i'm safe.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Your you I me you know it's all it's all prescribed in in the physical world.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:56.000
And you know the the postal system is key in that and that's a whole sidebar, and you know making the analogy for the postal

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Yeah, I mean, I I feel like in the meta project There's this challenge of of individuals representing themselves in an effect effective way.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Embody, you know, avatarring themselves for verb, you know, to to just be able to walk into the room.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Say here I am and figure you're out how to connect to people, and that's independent of then somebody collating that information, curating it, acting as a matchmaker acting as a you know hr department

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:55.000
delegating responsibilities, making contracts, you know, official or implicit.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:15.000
And I like i'm attracted to Google docs only cause it seems like the dumbest you know generally available language.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:20.000
You know, doesn't involve a learning curve for most people.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:26.000
The other thing that honestly attracts me is and I I wonder about, and I don't wanna say me cause it.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:44.000
I mean It's just like I wonder about is like linkedin, you know, like if if the meta project were a group on linkedin where like people and I mean I hate the idea of a centralized platform it's just that like

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:57.000
everybody's already there, and you could or link tree for that matter where you could like, you know, have some way of saying I proclaim myself to be mad.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:06.000
A project, and here is who I am, and like I want to describe myself and my willingness to participate in some way.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Anyway. i'm dumping a bunch of stuff but yeah, that's that's I i'm i'm like kind of frustrated to find myself I feel like in a little bit of engaged in something

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:38.000
of conflict might be too strong word, but just sort of like tension with people that have No, I have no disagreement with, you know.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:46.000
It's just that i'm trying to open it wide end of spiel.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Do you want to go first? Monday? Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:15.000
I I think it was no coincidence that I was away last week, like I think there's a need for these processes to be tried by quite a few different people, and for all of us to come together inside the frustration to try to

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:30.000
find a better solution, and I feel you I feel your pain you know it's it's it's a lot of work to even just put together a a one spreadsheet like that i'm sure it took you hours right not

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:45.000
that. Okay, sure. Okay, good even better. Then But it's one of those like one of those things about working together that we all know we need.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:51.000
We all know that we need something we've been describing these things inside of every group.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:58.000
If we only had this right. we've been all describing that is and we all recognize that it's pretty much baseline like this is just baseline.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.000
There's so many other things we could do if we could get this baseline down.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:09.000
And yet I have found, too, and I I heard I think I heard this in what you were saying.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:21.000
But correct. me if i'm wrong that when we go to share like, just the seed of it right here's just the first step that we're taking and mapping this thing they're immediately we get responses like, Yeah, But it'd

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000
be great if we could like incorporate the world and if we could right and so, and this isn't good enough.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:37.000
And why couldn't you scrape linkedin and why couldn't you, you know, and it's like cause i'm one person, and I only had 2Â h and this is is so i'm having a hard time getting the right

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:42.000
feedback right being in being nebulous like I don't mean to be Judy about it.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:49.000
But it's to get feedback. that will help take what there is one more step forward, right?

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Not a 1 million steps forward, and not that that feedback isn't all valuable right to help paint a picture of where we need to go, or what the vision is.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:05.000
But when the scope is so huge it's hard to create a bridge that's just the next step of the bridge, right?

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:10.000
We're trying to get across the grand canyon and We all know what we're going to look like on the other side.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.000
We started to have a vision of what is But but we need a bridge, and to build that bridge.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
You know we're trying to and we don't even know what the bridge looks like.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:21.000
We're not sure what we're making out of brand new no one's ever really figured this out We have pieces.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.000
We kind of know what this bridge kind of bridge looks like that kind of bridge.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
But we're talking about the grand canyon here.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.000
None of those bridges are gonna work, so we need to figure out something else.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.000
And and so we take one step and everybody goes. Yeah, I mean the steps sort of good.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I guess I can't really get much out of it could you build the whole bridge like you know next week would be really great. So I'm, that's where i'm i'm reading into your frustration I know that's

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:52.000
where my frustration is is and i'm coming to the conclusion like i'll just keep taking steps I'll keep taking the next right step.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:58:03.000
That makes the most sense to me from what i'm hearing not because I shared it and got good feedback, but because it seems like the right next step from what i'm hearing. and i'll just keep doing that until eventually the

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:17.000
bridge is far enough along that people start going Oh, and the conversation starts to move, so I i'm i'm with you like I don't think you've I don't know I I kinda wanna curious about your comments about feeling like you made

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.000
some enemies, I I certain you know, or like people are mad at you.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:32.000
What was the phrase? you feel like people are mad. at you for maybe misrepresenting, or I don't know I don't think I went that for it. but it's like being in conflict with people that you don't even think

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:40.000
they would be

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:44.000
That. Then sorry I mean, are you? Are you looking for an answer?

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Yeah. Yeah. clear point of clarification. I was right with the other.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Some of the other stuff. I was saying Then that would be my next question for you, which is, you know? where What was that about?

01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:05.000
A conflict piece. Well, I mean I guess I mean just just to storytell, and maybe i'll pick this out for for Wendy.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:17.000
You know I I had the experience of being somebody who raised their hand to execute, you know.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Task that was asked the collective of like let's get people together and output the the skills and passions and talk about how we connect people.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:46.000
And I did that in a Google Doc. and one group of people came together, and you know, and I i'm thinking as I as I tell this, you know, like it's it's interesting one person's reaction i'm telling this in in

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:53.000
non personified Wendy e friendly ways, you know.

01:59:53.000 --> 02:00:00.000
One person said, Okay, so I can manifest this in in my tool and

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:06.000
And and so the out of that first meeting, you know, that was sort of where we got to.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:18.000
And then, in a second meeting a totally different cast showed up and said, Oh, this isn't the way to do this I can manifest this a different way.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:25.000
And and and you know somebody else was saying this isn't even the way we should be thinking about it.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:46.000
And and then I came back to the person who had sort of in a way assigned the task, who said, Well, we have to show this result of that question for the task, and and doctored it some more.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:58.000
And then we showed that, and then everybody converged on Why, it wasn't the right way to do it and like i'm not attached to the way of doing it at all.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:01.000
I'm just like I was just fulfilling the assignment.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:09.000
So like the tension was sort of like what I I I was back channeling.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Okay, i'll end story and and say I was back channeling with Pete.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:17.000
As this was going on, and I said, I feel like a pinata, Yeah.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.000
And and or like the spreadsheet with the pinata really

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:29.000
And so so yeah, that was the thing I mean I I didn't really feel like people were mad at me.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:39.000
It was just sort of like all these points of frustration, which I totally get. I mean, I feel that frustration, too.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:50.000
And but it's just a funny thing and I and I I hear what you're saying, -oh. i'll wrap this up because I know Pete and on both ones say something i'm just responding to you

02:01:50.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Wendy but what you were saying about like we need to build a bridge across the grand canyon, and we're all about 3 feet out building separate bridges, and and like you know, i'm gonna in and your statement of like

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:18.000
i'm gonna keep building and and you know hoped that like I I mean i'm i'm extrapolating on what you were saying a little bit.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:24.000
But hope that people see that i've i've got a good start, and they coalesce around the bridge.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:40.000
I'm building, and together we can build this this bridge across but that's the same thing that everybody's saying to themselves, and bye, and that's not not to say that's wrong and not to say that never works and and

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:47.000
it's sort of fun honestly it's the way that we're used to in in capitalist world, you know.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:03:06.000
I mean it's sort of like everybody's you know inventing, and somebody hits on the right the right time and winning, and and even in in the cooperative world where you know we're wanting

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:15.000
everybody to cooperate on a thing that we win by having come up with the way that people are going to cooperate.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.000
And it's just tough it's and I understand it completely.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:26.000
, you know I don't know how to beat it, you know, and and part of it is economic part of it is.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:33.000
But even for someone like me, where where i'm happy to take the pieces of my bridge and give them to someone else.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:39.000
We're not wired anymore to think about receiving that from someone else. right?

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:47.000
So even when I try to offer up stuff, people go Oh, Oh, Yeah, that's nice, and move on like i'm like No, no, no, you know it's hearing it differently, too.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.000
In the conversation is part of it as well but anyway, i'll stop there.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:04:08.000
. I I hear you sorry so pete thanks so So that's that's one of the knots from this week.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:13.000
I know of, like like 2 or 3 more about the same size.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:33.000
I think one's actually bigger and Then like a few more that are smaller that are aren't so naughty so. and and and a lot of it is I so it so I guess I feel weird I I don't know

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:38.000
about which one of those to talk about even because it's like they're big problems, right?

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:49.000
But the the meta thing for me is somehow we ended up fracturing and

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Which the my! my story of how that stills happening is is, I think, naive.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:06.000
My story of how that stops happening is, everybody just takes kind of like rule.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Maybe not 0, but one or 2 rule one or 2 is try to try to speak in the same place altogether, rather than like breaking apart. Right?

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:24.000
It's like Oh, i'm talking with 3 people but we're standing, you know, we're standing outside.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:32.000
We're not in the room with everybody else and so obviously let's just stop talking.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Let's go back to the room with everybody else and start talking again.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:41.000
There's there's some part of that which is is right and some part of that is like massively wrong.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:53.000
So hi! w when do I like your right next step thing that's It's similar to what I've been doing.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:06:01.000
And and actually it sounds a little bit smarter than what I've been doing, I think. but and and i'm not sure how I would even articulate what what I but I it it's more like for me I guess

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:06.000
it's everybody should figure out what's most important for them and start doing that.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:27.000
And you know. and look across you know look across everybody else. and at least adjust your your personal what's the next right thing, so that it's also starting to align with our other people's most right thing right. and it's kind

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:36.000
of funny. I you know really originally I mean Jordan, was the the reason. The the most attractive thing about Meta Project lines.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Bergen Jordan for me. was journalists always really good about saying, Hey, Hey, Come down.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:50.000
It's Okay, all we have to do is like look for the the same North Star that everybody else is looking at, and and we'll get there.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:07:06.000
We'll all get there together so it's it's kind of funny that we haven't been doing that very well, for I don't know a a month or 2 or something like that So with all the knots that

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:18.000
arose this week, and and the the harder ones are the ones that were not in the right groups and not in the right places talking

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:32.000
And so it's a it's a meta problem where i'm at a matter problem because and then trying to fix it turns into a meta Meta meta-problem you know it's like

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000
because I kind of raise my hand and say Okay, we're we're doing something the wrong way.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:44.000
But It's gonna take 2 2 hops of the you know of this part of the bridge to get there, and those parts of the bridge.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Aren't there. So you know how do we all do that together? How do we like?

02:07:49.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Try to make it across those hops that aren't there together, or at least arrive on the you know, on the on the solid part of the bridge, and be able to reasssemble ourselves, or something like that so it it seems

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:11.000
like you know it's not only a it it's not only like the How do we see each other part?

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:17.000
But it's like, How do we even end up in the same room together to be able to see each other?

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:26.000
And how do we end up in the same room together? And here, here he each other, be able to listen to each other so that we can talk about what we do right? Yeah.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:34.000
And then, more importantly, how do we recognize the moments when they come that 5 of us need to leap together to the next right?

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Not one person but 5 people now need to leap together to the next platform, and and and to time that, and to coordinate it. right.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:49.000
I I do see that Meta from my perspective meta project that's the genius.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:09:00.000
If we can figure it out it's the coordination it's not the it's not what each sovereign is doing as you're pointing out we need to have the governor's structure in order to see each

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:06.000
other right, and in in our sovereigns we need people also, being responsible and mindful about their role.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Right and creating a sovereign helps helps do that people don't need to have a project in order to do that there's a lot of new thinking in that, for people and then I think the the the beauty that comes from it the

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.000
the potential that sits there is that Meta project can then be the place where things get coordinated.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:41.000
And I mean that with with a sense of purpose, and a sense of true power over being an organization that has no top down, you have to do what I'm telling you to do.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:45.000
The the directive comes from the bottom up, so it has to be like almost like this.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:58.000
This magnetic field, where, where all this all this stuff from the sovereigns is, is being discovered, and being seen on a metal level, even if it's not being seen by individual sovereigns, right, we need mapping, for that and

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.000
We need sense makers for that, and we need weavers for that.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:09.000
And we need facilitators for that right. and then, being able to make enough sense of that, that we can coordinate something, create a plan and disseminate it back out.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:15.000
So people understand what they're supposed to be doing or being in in, not even as a directive, but as an invitation right?

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Not everyone's gonna say yes to and do that forever do that continually.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:25.000
And I I do think that that's a possibility but we need to get through these things first.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:31.000
And I I i'm gonna throw out here, too, I think the importance of the facilitators in this role. Right?

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Is is can't be understated i'm starting to think more and more.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:44.000
It would be helpful to have people trained in facilitation as emergent leaders, As facilitated leaders, so on mute facilitations are usually very soft.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Kind of term. I mean it in a very powerful way of people coming into the room with the intention of bringing people together with the intention of solving some of these issues around.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:02.000
How we're listening to each other when we're listening to each other, What kinds of meetings, what's the agenda for the meeting?

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.000
How do we want to establish? What kind of feeling do we want people to leave?

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:10.000
With what kind of objectives do we have? I think we could be facilitating the meetings better.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:16.000
I feel like we could be built using them to build the community.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:20.000
That will help like I just think all that it's not bad but it could be better.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:25.000
And the longer we go where we're not doing that the longer we go without the sense making.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Then the longer we go feeling like we're investing our time and not getting what we want out of it.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:36.000
And eventually that's just gonna frustrate people so so that's kind of like the read I've been taking.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:43.000
I like it. I mean, there are. There are communities that facilitators ready to go.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Do you know what I mean, and but they're not connected yet to Meta, and the biggest one I know of is through Tray.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:53.000
But she's very busy. I i'm assuming I could do that.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:57.000
The question is a similar question. I think to a lot of people who've touched with Meta.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:04.000
They see the potential they get excited by What Could happen the question is where's the right timing right now?

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:09.000
I feel like the only person you can say the timing is is now is Jordan.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:17.000
He's the only one who's seeing all the pieces clearly enough, and so.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:27.000
And that's an issue too, because it's a funnel there, that that that that we all kind of need and I and i'm not hearing enough from him so I actually started to put together a list of all the projects

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:35.000
i've thrown into the soup and i'm waiting and I think it's numbering in like 9 or 10 going.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
We could do things this way. We could do things this way.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:45.000
We could do things. I think all of these pieces are important so now i'm going. I think maybe I need to make a map of all the pieces, and how they intersect with each other.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:49.000
You know, just to start to say here's what my bridge is looking like I haven't even built it yet.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Here's what my but I here's what a bridge could maybe look like, and even then I don't think it's fully formed, and don't even know if this helps but right so that's kind of where i've

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:11.000
been sitting because we need to get it out of jordan's head, and and i'm i'm not sure how to do that. I I feel like we could just do that or or I feel like it can just be done I

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:24.000
guess without Jordan so I i've got I've got kind of a list like that. i've got a list of my stuff. And then I've got a list also of stuff that I know of yeah, Yes, . right and to me that's what

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:29.000
I wanna do but we don't have it yet, and I don't feel like we can wait.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:33.000
I'm not sure we can wait I would be very .

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Working on this, you know, with with you P. or anybody else who's interested in kind of going I would love to you.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Would, too. Yeah, I mean one thing I wanted to mention was if if you if you visit the odious spreadsheet spreadsheet.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:02.000
You will see that there's

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Sheet to and sheet 3, which include one of which at least includes this sort of all Caps brain dump that Jordan did while we were meeting, and subsequently went to I mean I I had a conversation.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:40.000
With Jordan the morning before the meeting, where he, like, came up with all those categories of sort of existing sovereigns, and needed sovereigns, and that became the vertical.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:15:10.000
You know the the the the categories that are along the the x-axis and he also kind of summarized both the the Meta project, and in in in Jordanese and then also

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:22.000
said some stuff about how he saw the project working in relation to the skills and and passions, and it's in there.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:30.000
And I i said to him, look I feel like i'm gonna i'm gonna take this out of the spreadsheet itself.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:45.000
So the spreadsheet is just the people and the and the whatever they are, need slash, sovereign slash categories.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:16:01.000
And and I think this needs some development and I mean I honestly think it's sort of the seed of I don't know if it's the lionsburg or the meta project you know kind of web page

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Primer Wiki I don't know I don't I'm not exactly sure what it is.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:32.000
But to me, you know, it relates to branding and description of what it is, what the hell we're all doing and and getting it from like bracketed slightly difficult to penetrate language to simpler language

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:52.000
So I I point you to that. and and also say that you know I move to trying to help make sense of that together, and I , It's the about the project patient I needed Yeah, about the project is is I think .

02:16:52.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Maybe i've i've re-type some of it in not all caps. Basically, basically it was it was a drag, because I wasn't in something where I could say, Oh, change case.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Unfortunately, we type the whole thing but that's That's Jordan's language.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:21.000
And yeah, I mean, this is yeah,

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:30.000
And then the earlier version, I see and other earlier versions what's with and whip, too, work in progress.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Yeah, I mean, I know what what what means. I just mean, What were they?

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:48.000
, we were ones or older ones. let's see Let me just look here and see what's where Sorry I was looking at the document as I was describing it.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:58.000
So I I Working progress, too, is the cleanest version of what? Just what?

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Jordan had typed but that's the about the project.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.000
But then there was another portion. Sorry this is another document i'll have to pull it out.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:23.000
That was more about the the tasks yeah no, it's there. it's in whip, not whip, too.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:31.000
We're setting up the game a starting point and then it' Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I see it in there.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Yeah. yeah, yeah. whip just plain with is is jordan's original typing on top of the spreadsheet.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:51.000
So That's what I was working from and so you ended up basically with kind of 2 things would, if i'm hearing you right, Jordan's dump right for lack of a it's a crude term but for lack of the

02:18:51.000 --> 02:19:11.000
better right is his brain dump And then the the mapping of the people's and passions and skills right for for that came from the chat stream spreadsheet document have been shown initially the week before what

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:23.000
came from from Jordan Wednesday morning. Was this this brain dump into the previously existing spreadsheet?

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.000
I mean what you see there in the the I guess it's fourth sheet, the , whip.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Sheet is, what have what had happened by the end of my conversation with Jordan?

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:48.000
And and then I pruned it to the people. Needs thing, which is what we shared at the Wednesday meeting, and and, you know, was in the process of separating out.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:58.000
The his brain dumped into something else, because it didn't seem like the spreadsheet was the place for the whole treatise.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:06.000
But you know it. it definitely is an important thing, and we want but in some form that people can consume.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Yes, I mean I I When I look at this I see 2 things with which I think you were echoing.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:27.000
One is something, you know, information that ends up on a website or ends up and and helps to explain what the Meta project is to the average person, something that can be shared by members of Meta Project to other people to help them

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:41.000
know what's going on. The step by step see where I guess these 3 things, step by step, is visualizing to me, is almost like a flow right, and we need to work on a flow of onboarding of integrating of connection some

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:54.000
some that flows through people, some that throws through tools that's. What's forming in my mind and has been percolating for the last couple of weeks is this need for some sort of flow document to start creating the

02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:01.000
architecture. both technical and interpersonal and so that we can start to figure that piece out.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:14.000
I think that's really detailed and and and heavy work. you know that's gonna potentially, not just conceptual, but like actually what you know, we'll start bringing out what we need to do, and who needs to do it and what

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:19.000
the roles are and stuff which i've been reluctant to do on my own, because I really want it.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:22.000
I think that's something that would be wise to do in in a group of people.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:30.000
So his step by step. to me is the beginning of that and i'm happy to work on that if that feels like that's a priority.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:33.000
And then the last one is the the spreadsheet of needs and stuff.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:38.000
I feel like we already have the that could be easily integrated.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:41.000
It would be kind of manual, but I would be okay to do.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:53.000
I would be willing to do it. where we Take the profile side of the information with, and put in included in the air table profile side of

02:21:53.000 --> 02:22:01.000
What you know what's already been curated on the air table, and then take the project side of what's been shared, and put it into the project.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Connect the people in the projects together. so the first one being like Billy Anderson, and of course massive wikis to me.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:18.000
That would be a connection from him to to the project of massive wikis right so to identify him as somebody who wants to work on massive wiki, or is for Campus Wiki.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:27.000
We have both of those threads already. established inside the so it would be easy to just echo it with this new information not tapestry.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:31.000
That's just you know getting it in into the place where we've already curated some other things.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:35.000
So we can put them together into one place that but again.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Like there's no point in doing all that work if we're not going to use the air table in some way, or if there's a different way that people want to see this right so i'm i'm looking for feedback from this

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:57.000
group. As to whether we think that that's the next right step together, I mean one thing I would say to that is that I I do think, and and you know I know Pete pizza's initial reaction to this thing

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:02.000
was. This should be an air table and and and has pulled.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:05.000
What the initial version of it into Errors table

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Which, and and it should be in the air table stuff that that is already done for.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Sure I mean it. it doesn't like pulling sorry so I guess there are sort of 3 pieces which I think i'm echoing what you were saying?

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Wendy, like there's, there's the profile which individuals what to feel, some ability to show up and say here's me, and and where that exists, and whether they have to like be comfortable in air table to give that or

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:56.000
can give that on in whatever thing whether it's Google Doc.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Or not or set you know we have a type form or something I don't know I don't I don't know what the best way and that that's a whole you know conversation itself.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:23.000
That super, you know low barrier to entry, no barrier to entry way for somebody to show up and and self-identify

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:38.000
And then there's the list of projects the list of what's now, you know, written across the top by Jordan.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Identified needs. You know whether whether what Jordan said is right or not, whether some of those things need to be combined, whether there are things that are missing, I mean the list of of of projects and then how that matches up

02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:03.000
with the the people who might want to be involved with the with those projects.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.000
That is a bit of matchmaking job is a bit of an Hr.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Job is a bit of a self-identification. I want to work on this thing.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:17.000
Yeah, there's a there's a lot to be clarified about that.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Then sorry. I was saying that was 3 thing there were 3 things that those 3 things were the we're the first.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Well, there are those 3 things then separate from that there's a sort of fourth and fifth thing.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:40.000
I guess, which is the the explaining what the Meta project is.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:57.000
Piece of of you know about about the project Jordan's, you know, Brain dump there, and then what you were identifying as the process that is in the steps piece of jordan's jordan's brand

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:05.000
up which relates to those first 3 like, you know. So how do we take the people?

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:19.000
The needs and like, make them hello together as as some projects.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Yeah, I I have a feeling like like you know, the the past hour.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:41.000
I feel like we could get all a lot farther Seems Seems to me that the problem that we've got is we're trying to fit everything into the a little bit it's a little bit more than this but we're

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:47.000
trying to fit everything, all the coordination into the 90Â min of the navigation call. Hmm.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Wish to 2Â h, which turns into a little bit more than 2Â h.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:27:00.000
I if we so I in in chat, you know

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Most of these things Overlap map weavers overlap with skills and passions which overlaps and both of those overlap with the Lionsburg wiki.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:25.000
There's a thing I don't know if you guys even know about, called the Start Page project, which is me and Eric and Jordan is about it to have a guidance, you know 1 one start page where you could get you know

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:30.000
into the flow of of Lionsburg, and you know, dispatch you to the right part of.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:39.000
I need to know more about the project, or I need. You know the Directory, or I need whatever

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:50.000
And then story sovereign which I don't know somebody here must be working with Wendy Alford on that right?

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:54.000
So straight. sovereign is kind of it also overlaps without right.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:28:01.000
It's like taking the view that just like we needed a start. Page.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:08.000
We also need an understanding of of stories and story modeling and stuff like that.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:16.000
And then there's social dimensions which I think maybe Michael, you don't know about that.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Oh, cool. So part of the social dimensions is chugging along, too, trying to solve things and resolve things and stuff like that.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:30.000
And then, you know, Then there's maybe smaller things like smaller smaller and bigger, massive decentralization.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:38.000
My little project a massive coordination which is going to be a project on top of massive decentralization.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:55.000
So I feel like where we've we've been doing a lot of work. but we haven't had enough meetings where we're just coordinating right this kind of stuff, because we could have we should be collapsing some

02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:03.000
of the stuff. and then I can also kind of just see that there are

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:09.000
I don't mean that we need to all be doing the same thing, or or that we need to throw out duplicates kind of.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:16.000
But we but we should at least be coordinating the parallel projects, or the close duplicates.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:33.000
So So, for instance, the start page Well, maybe that's a bad way to start map weavers and the skills and passions spreadsheet is kind of should be co- last map weavers what it's doing

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:40.000
and the Lionsburg wiki are probably like, close their their siblings and they overlap some.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:52.000
But I think you want both of those you want it you want something that's very database, oriented, and you want something that's kind of qualitative and hypergraph hypertexty, story

02:29:52.000 --> 02:30:05.000
sovereign and social dimensions are kind of attempts at

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Actually, maybe there's kind of a gradient from map weavers and catalyst to the lionsburg wiki to stories.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Where those things are all serving the same need kind of helping people understand it.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:30.000
And since making what we're doing but in different representations and and I guess I wanna make sure that i'm not I. I.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:36.000
I'm really not arguing that we want to do all those together like like we could have a wiki.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:42.000
That does all of that. that's the wrong way to do it, or we could have a directory that does all that. That's the wrong way to do it.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Or we could have just stories and that's the wrong way to do it.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:52.000
We haven't been doing enough cross-coordination between those projects to you know.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Say, Hey, here's the stuff that we're representing in in catalyst here's the the way that we're, you know.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Here's a similar set of things that we're we're representing in massive wiki, and maybe a profile looking or something like that.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:12.000
And here's how all of those things flow together and work together.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:17.000
So can let me just share screen. and I have to go soon.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:20.000
But I thought this would be useful. this is where i'm starting to think about.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Maybe mapping some stuff. This isn't flow this is just mapping.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:31.000
So before our brains go okay there's nothing about the stuff we're working on that sits in boxes.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:36.000
I'm just gonna acknowledge that there's nothing about the stuff that we're working on sits in boxes, right?

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:41.000
It's it's all interconnected however, starting to add, understand a bit better.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:47.000
The unique flavor of each one will help us do the discernment that I think will help us.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Then communicate to each other. Hey, if you could work on this piece i'll work on this piece.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:59.000
We'll come bring it back together right so to me even though a view like this one makes it seem like everyone's working separate.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:07.000
It's also a spiral it's also all network right so i'm just trying to help parse it to me.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:19.000
They're you know again I there's a bunch of stuff I've been. I've been promoting. I was trying to use the pieces that I knew existed and going Okay, So we've got a media piece where

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
website's gonna be built. we've got a social dimensions.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:31.000
It's really working on relationship Dynamics. I was trying to start up something called the Wisdom Council, which is really trying to read the read.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:36.000
This, read the field, read the community, and and communicate things from there back at back to the community.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:47.000
We've got the infrastructure pieces of doing massive wiki, which is the way I understood it was a little bit of a knowledge repository kind of thing.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Lines works done a bunch of research on. governance and of course we have all the stuff that you've just done on structure, Pete and I'm not.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:59.000
I wasn't sure what what what to name it then we've got the request to me. This is different.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:04.000
This. This is A. This is more about process and less about function.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:09.000
So this diagram came from a couple of different sources it's.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:19.000
I created it. But it's it's based on a couple of different sources. And really it's about how we need to make sure we're always doing recording for guidance right which is this path.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:29.000
How we're always doing process. and program management which is this path how we're always putting what we're seeing from a meta perspective back out into the community.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:33.000
That's this path I haven't seen this one really emerged.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Yet. I think maybe this is where wendy alfred kind of sits like, and I know trade does some of this work, too, where it's like you get these feedback loops like you're you're doing

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:47.000
questionnaires on, and surveys and stuff so to me This is one of those.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:52.000
It's a very tapestry kind of thing of way of thinking, because, of course, it's me so i'm going.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Okay, how does it fit into frameworks that I know have already been created?

02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:08.000
How we're with the things that we've been that have been emerging, and have been starting to codify a sovereigns are fitting nicely, actually into these things that have been codified by other people in the

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:14.000
past, and it's also highlighting an area that's missing, that we might want to make sure we think about so it to me.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Both of these things are doing that I i'm feeling i'm in my mind, starting to fill in all these sections.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Now whether we do it in this view, or we do it in a chart, view it it doesn't matter to me what it looks like, but I think there's value, and starting to help people see where they sit and what you know and

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:40.000
asking the question. Sometimes we don't even know we think we're doing everything, having to having to do with governance.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:50.000
And then, when we start talking about real as well no you have this flavor on governance, and I have this flavor on governance, and so we can help to see where we're complementing each other and where we're

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:57.000
duplicating. work I i'm just yeah I don't know if that helps It's what i'm starting to play around with.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:03.000
Oh, I could. Okay, i'm happy to share this mirror with everybody, and we can call collaborate on it.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:09.000
If you want to do miro we don't have to though I would. I would like to look at it.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:12.000
I don't know how much i'll operate on it.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:19.000
I I wonder using your bridge metaphor I wonder if I I feel like Let me try this i'm tied in my head.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Now try it, and speech I feel like we we started seeing the Meta Project Bridge getting built, and there's a whole bunch of it that doesn't exist.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:46.000
But the folks on this call I feel like we're so one of the weird things about the Meta project is every is in this different stage of of feeling good about you know, even even talking about you know working together.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:50.000
They're people who are scared to death of talking about working together.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:54.000
They're they're really really and that that you know that thing.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:36:04.000
There are people who actually need that bridge built before they can feel safe, taking many steps, you know, on a creaky, not bridge yet.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Then there are other folks who are a lot further ahead in feeling bridge like.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:16.000
So the people on this call I feel like we don't actually need the bridge, or we can.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:27.000
We can each pretend that we're like a little joan and we can make a virtual bridge across, and we can kind of see you know how you can hop from going to drone to drone and it's like look we're doing

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:32.000
a bridge thing you you know it's just like a bridge, and everybody else is like no dude.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:44.000
It's not like a bridge to the off across looks terrible So I I feel like the thing that like we've been doing the Joan thing, and we're even doing it you know.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:52.000
We're doing it in a reasonable formation but we haven't acknowledged that that can be part of.

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:59.000
I feel like we haven't acknowledged that that can be the Meta project, too, because Jordan has been driven.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Jordan has been driving like we have to get the bridge bills, so the people across it, and it's like you know.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Let's just do it. I think we could do it I think we could just.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Yes, I I feel like if a couple of these patterns of processes of how we work together could get smoothed out.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:31.000
We'd actually already have the new thing that we need And then, if the focus again is on coordination, I I I think i'm gonna start this gonna kind of be my mantra that's cause it's really screaming,

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:38.000
loudly in my head. By now the the gift meta project can give is the coordination. right.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:44.000
It's like a one analogy may maybe this won't work, but for me it's it's a it's a good analogy.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:47.000
It's the parent. it's gonna sound I don't.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Yeah, I don't know if this is gonna come off quite right but the parent, I think the greatest gift of parent can give to a child to remind the child where they've been.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:01.000
How they've gotten through something before and where they could go with it right?

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:09.000
It's that there's a coordination that happens when we say here's where we've been i'm gonna remind you of your own story.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:21.000
I'm gonna tell you where we're at right now and i'm gonna tell you where that could go, and then off you go again right like then, I I love that. And I like to add one more thing

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:27.000
here's where you could go and you have to decide you get to decide, and you have to decide.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:39.000
You have agency you're the one that This is why the parent isn't quite right. That's right, because it it kind of implies that if you don't do what I for a lot of people that implies we

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:43.000
don't do what i'm at suggesting you do there's going to be a problem which it isn't.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:47.000
It's really an invitation right here's one option right or something.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:54.000
So it's and and to me that's that loop those are all those loops of process are really meant to help support that process.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
So each sovereign gets a visual of who they are.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:01.000
They get an opportunity to say This is what i'm working on oh, this is what you're working on.

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:10.000
Oh, let me give let's give you some thoughts on that Oh, okay, now, let's let's hear from you Here's what we need to ask because we know it's we Meta we know what's going on across

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:14.000
the board. So we need these questions, answered right now so we're gonna put out a survey.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:19.000
We're gonna hear back so there and then we're gonna report what we hear.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:22.000
We're gonna report out to everybody so that you can make sense for yourself.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:30.000
What your next rate step is knowing it's either aligned starting to align more with Meta, or your choice starting to go away from Meta.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Both are fine, but you can't know that If we don't tell you what it's going on.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.000
Then we have another one that says, Hey, have all new people all new things welcome.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:42.000
We're gonna do a little more onboarding we're gonna do a little more.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:47.000
Do you have an opportunity to do a little presentation or you Have It rates all the new stuff, and we're back to hey?

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:51.000
Report to us tell us what you're working on and we're going, and it just keeps going round.

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:57.000
If these 4 functions have been identified repeatedly in many places, right, then not functions, processes.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:10.000
To me it makes sense to make sure we're working those in so that we don't all go insane because otherwise it's just a bunch of sense making laying out there that's not drawing itself together and then we're back to

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:15.000
doing that same same processes, but we're doing them for ourselves as sovereigns.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:21.000
It's not being coordinated so to me it's that coordination piece we're not taking away the action piece that resides with the sovereigns.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:24.000
We are going to and we're not even taking away the coordination piece.

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:30.000
We're just hoping we're lifting the coordination piece to to bring it around.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Everyone it it's a it's a tall task I don't you know.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:38.000
I think our company struggle at doing this all the time, and they can tell people what to do.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:42.000
You know i'm tired of everybody fighting and nobody getting anything done.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:46.000
You do it, get it done right, and it will happen. So I think it.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:55.000
This is not. this is no small feat but I keep this is what's been patterning for me for the last

02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:08.000
I think you know I think it's cool that you look , I think it's cool that we have flotilla as a place for this conversation.

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:13.000
And and it's funny and and I think it's the right thing.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:18.000
The flotilla doesn't really show up on the map.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:31.000
Yet it will be subsumed that is really funny it's it's kind of like Why, it'sotilla is it's in a way it's it's meta for the meta project or something like that and you

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:44.000
know it's like it wouldn't show up on the mouth because it's like above the map or like ,

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:48.000
You know that's what I see that's you know which is very flotilla, too.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:54.000
But to me that's we're not doing specifically flotilla things right now with friends who've gotten to know each other.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:58.000
We have deep connection with each other. We trust each other we're sharing things that may be a little bit vulnerable like.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:10.000
I was feeling this way or is feeling that way i'm thinking this thing that I wasn't I wasn't willing to share in the large Meta project. yet, but it's really helped me to voice it here right so thank you to my

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:19.000
friends. Thank you to your friends. I I I felt a little vulnerable bringing up shit I was bringing up, but you know thank you.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:25.000
I'm so glad you did i'm still glad we talked about this yeah good job.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:32.000
All i'm sorry I i'm gonna have to drop off. I have a meeting and 15, and I need to prep a bit for it.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:37.000
For those of you who know zeke Oh, yeah i'm meeting up with him.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:43.000
He's really taking a lead and drawing together the the people that have been surrounding him for a while, and trying to coordinate it.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:52.000
So i'm trying to see i'm actually trying to listen into what he's doing, and set up a meeting with Jordan was interested in getting to know what what they're up to So I'm trying to create a

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:57.000
bridge. so but you'd all be interested in that so that's my meeting at 3.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:04.000
I gotta figure out you gotta get some food. My, so my main takeaway is we need more working sessions like this through the week.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:11.000
Kind of at least for a little while. Yeah. and and my main takeaway is maybe a A.

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:16.000
And I would love support from other people like a Yes, for about this would be good.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Is try to advocate for facilitation more active facilitation.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:33.000
On the Wednesday meeting, so that there's more like There's more of an intention for what we want to do with them, and there's more an intention for what we want to get out of them not that I haven't enjoyed every

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:38.000
single one, because I have it's more yeah I feel I feel like we're not.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:42.000
I have. I have an adjacent one, which is, I feel like we need to get.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:48.000
We need to decide to get less done during the navigation meetings.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:53.000
That's one way to write and then Take all that work and and and those are in other meetings is what you're thinking.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Yeah, and they're really really great ways to create connection between people, too.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:13.000
And so if that's the goal of the Wednesday meetings I mean, I would be interested to see you know, a reaction from from a group of people, or even just from Jordan on what process are we trying to establish

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:19.000
in the you know, in the Wednesday meetings, which one of those 4, if we were to pick one, is the primary goal.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Is it on boarding new people right? Is It and and helping them hear and see what's going on?

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:29.000
Is it feedback loops of hearing from the community what their biggest things are?

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:32.000
What is it status updates? Is it communicating out?

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Is it all, for I kind of always saw it as we do one each week, and we just rotate, you know, on the big meetings.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:47.000
But that's not my call I feel like it's not my call to make you know.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:52.000
But we've got other I think there's one or 2 more additional calls along with that call.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:45:06.000
So there's the Africa, call and then maybe one more so already we're I'm Well, so I I think again getting less done and doing it better.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:12.000
And then making sure that the stuff that we didn't get done, there gets done other places.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:17.000
So we need to.

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:27.000
I think that's smart. I really really do because this slowing down to go faster, kind of thing, and slowing down to get traction.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:32.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys were gonna talk about in person, get together in New York.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:40.000
I don't know if you could do that i'm gonna go get lunch.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Okay, Stacey, , before pete before you go because what you're saying about these working sessions like, why can't we just do like, Why can't you just say it and we do it?

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Like I don't know like hook the time no no reason.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:16.000
Yes, yes, basically. yes, I don't mean that that we should do it.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:29.000
And I and I I guess I you you're totally right I always watch people saying, Oh, this is when this is a really good idea, and we should do this, and in my head it's like okay, you just volunteered to

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:45.000
get it done. Yeah, we should the the reason not to do it right at this very moment is because it's been a long call already.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:47:06.000
Basically, that's the only thing stopping me i'm wondering why we don't designate like office hours like regular schedule office hours, and ask that like representative from each of the overlapping calls be at those off this

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:15.000
hour, and then each, you know, and that would almost be like , , sovereigns.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Basically cause they are each of those calls, if you think them as a sovereign can figure out how to make sure that at least some of them are there to coordinate and catch up with what they've done and then we can

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:40.000
So by working sessions I don't mean, or maybe a different way to say that

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:50.000
I I think we're wendy said Wendy was Wendy made a really good you know what what is what is Jordan trying to accomplish with these calls.

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:58.000
It's a I wanna say failure but i'm trying not to say it.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:09.000
It's it's it's basically a Maybe I can say this it's a project management fault kind of to have a meeting without a purpose.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:13.000
So the meetings right now don't really have a good stated purpose.

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:21.000
And so they and Jordan has got it in his head, and maybe he set it in the the email out before you know.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:25.000
Here's what I think is gonna happen on this call here's kind of where I want it to go.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:29.000
But I don't know what I mean I could maybe try to figure it out.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:39.000
What is I think most of us don't know why we're on that call what we're trying to accomplish we didn't you know we didn't plan to accomplish stuff on the call and so they're

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:58.000
they're machine and stuff like that the it's so maybe this is there's we have attention in meta project about getting to know each other or hanging out and getting stuff done and it's and it's funny to me that one of

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:19.000
the another issue. another issue going on. is the whole masculine energy sentiment, energy thing, or yin yang and that meme has attached itself to the let's hang out and let's get stuff done or you know let's let's figure out how

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:41.000
we're doing stuff and let's just start doing stuff right that they that map to me is a false friend. kind of but anyway, getting to know. well, so maybe we do need getting to know you calls and those might be

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:47.000
unstructured, but

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Taking the the the 2 or 3 calls that we've got already, and doing more of them is not what I want.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:02.000
So by by working, working session it's like you could identify.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:07.000
You know that that list I had of projects that are kind of kind of aligned map weavers, skills and passion.

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:16.000
The lions where Wiki start page project story, sovereign social dimensions and decentralization.

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Those people, the people running those things should get together once in a while and say, Hey, can we?

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:30.000
How, what's what's the same thing and the different thing between the wiki and map. weavers.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:36.000
You know. How can we help each other? How can we make sure that we're not unnecessarily duplicating effort?

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:43.000
How can, when we, when we are duplicating effort, how can we make it most productive for both?

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:51.000
Both of us right, you know so. and and an example of that, just to continue the the thought in my head, not because you all need it, but

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
There is going to be a Lionsburg Wiki.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:51:01.000
There is a catalyst there's more or less a Lansbury Wiki already there is a a catalyst thing, you know.

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:11.000
If somebody posts a profile in the lions, where wiki, how does it end up in catalyst when somebody posts a profile in catalyst, how does it get linked?

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:14.000
Or how does it get copied over to the Lionsburg Wiki?

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:20.000
Right, and and more people than that. so so that's the kind of it.

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:36.000
We we kind of started doing that in today's call a lot of today's call was griping and moaning and and complaining because we were sad or frustrated, or whatever right But we at least

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:42.000
identified projects that are kind of doing that, Joan Virtual bridge thing.

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:46.000
And and you, you know we can start to talk about the lines that we need between them.

02:51:46.000 --> 02:52:06.000
The connections that we need between them and maybe a new thing for It's a new thing for me at least being able to articulate the difference between that virtual kind of bridge That looks to some of us like a perfectly good

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:22.000
bridge and to other people it looks like like here, not not a bridge, because, being able to articulate the difference between that and a fully built out bridge. and for the people coming in, We've got people who are on on the Lionsburg

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:29.000
calls the navigation calls. who are going? Okay, I see that you guys assert that there is a bridge, and all I see is air.

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:32.000
So what's up with that and Why, am I even here?

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:41.000
What's what are we doing you know and then there's other people who kind of get the the picture. look I can see the other end of the bridge is built But there's no way to get there from here and I I don't know if

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:53.000
I'm gonna come to the next call because you guys don't know how to build bridges right? So we've got this confusion about levels of confidence levels of maturity levels of of done.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:53:03.000
This, you know, and ways of dealing with that and things like that that were really not articulating well, that we started to articulate a little bit in this call.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:13.000
So the kinds of calls where we spend an hour or 90Â min together talking about profiles, or talking about skills and passions.

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:24.000
And how do you represent skills and passions in the Wiki in by week, and plus dispatch and catalyst And how do those?

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:28.000
How do we not? I guess you know we're all kind of waiting?

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:33.000
I think we've all been kind of waiting for for Jordan to say, this needs to be done, but we don't.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:45.000
We really don't want to I mean we shouldn't we shouldn't, because we're you know we're bottleneck already, and it's just gonna get worse right so to your answer or to your question stacy we should just

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:54.000
schedule some times to work together. I think the right way to do that is to schedule a working sessions with people you know who are interested in.

02:53:54.000 --> 02:54:04.000
I guess Maybe this is a new thing for me too. maybe it's Cross Project coordination stuff, you know, so so we don't.

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:14.000
We've been doing. okay on map weavers calls or Wikipedia calls, or things like that the thing that we haven't had.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:20.000
And the thing that I recognize today is we need to have calls that are across.

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:24.000
You know, projects that are doing similar things, but different things right?

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:34.000
Wikipedia and start page and and map weavers should have another call for for all of those things together rather than just individual calls.

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:49.000
And maybe that's similar to Wendy when you kind of you know, called out the Meta project, is the coordination layer for a bunch of sovereigns working together, right, and I know this was a long call so i'll let

02:54:49.000 --> 02:55:04.000
you go, but I just wanna leave with questions. of maybe everything doesn't have to have a goal, and blows my mind, cause that sounds completely wrong, I know.

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:12.000
But I actually was thinking about this before I came here. so and I have more time to workulate it in a better way.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:19.000
It's really a worthwhile question to ask and so I was, you know I the there's I I totally agree.

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:25.000
I I love emergence. I love showing up for things and just watching what happens without a goal.

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:39.000
But but when you when you're more space for it because I want to articulate it better, because I was just listening, I can't think of the name the name of the man who was just talking about it.

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:45.000
He wrote a book called Difficult Conversations he's a former I think former Nfl.

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:50.000
Football player, Arano, or so I Can't think of the name he was speaking with.

02:55:50.000 --> 02:56:03.000
Matthew Mcconnell. and he was talking about how a goal is actually limiting, and I think there's something , , There's a There's a whole interesting.

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:11.000
So I I totally agree. goals aren't always needed when you're trying to do something, or when you're spending time.

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:21.000
People time and attention. if you don't at least have a goal of we're gonna hang out together. and this is how long we're going to hang out together.

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:27.000
So that it's a real common fault for people to say you know.

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:33.000
Let's get together and see what happens. you know and but in the back of their mind.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:48.000
I. But I want this to happen you know if you want things to happen, or if you're asking people to allocate time for you, then you kind of deserve to make a goal, even if the goal is we're just gonna hang out for 60Â min, and see

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:56.000
what emerges, and the other thing I wanted to say is and maybe i'm an anomaly but and I don't want to drown.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:09.000
But if i'm gonna drown I wanna drown with you guys, so i'll just say that I I agree that's why we're all here.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:23.000
I think alright nice spending time with you but i'll let you go by bye, and I just put the the link to Emmanuel otto who's the former Nfl player who

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:27.000
does uncomfortable conversations with a black man yeah it's really interesting.

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:34.000
Talk about it. Thank you. Bye and Pete.

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:41.000
I I would like to connect with you one of these days.
