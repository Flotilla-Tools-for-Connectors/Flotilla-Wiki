WEBVTT

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So I'm doing a, it's football or Friday. Sorry I'm taking

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
its little Friday on what day is it the 21st of January, do I get that day, right.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So, and I'm presenting just some the late, the stuff that's been coming out for me just in the last couple weeks. And so it's a project I'm calling the tapestry, and I'm trying to help provide some semblance of a way that we can start providing a framework

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:46.000
for all the people in all these groups to see each other better and to make connections and find synergies and possibly even more importantly find holes.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So, net analogy to a puzzle here and then.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So, in that framework I was trying to figure out what can I,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.000
what am I really trying to do here and what I'm really I tried to take the bigger picture the meta picture first and going what we're really trying to elevate people's thinking really trying to help them sense make really trying to help see perspective.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And that's when I drew this picture. And so for me this was just an individual's path and quite a few you've seen this before, and you've seen me explain it before.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So for me, this just was a separate piece but it started to guide my thinking as I continued so I'm gonna go keep going for speed.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Um, I was looking at, I was talking a lot in conversations with different people about the hierarchy of needs and I really like the First Nations perspective, better, which I think a lot of us feel more akin to and that we're really there's there's a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
nap. And I realized there's a natural spread in their hierarchy to where you are focusing on the individual.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And you're also focusing on the community, and and ultimate, you know, cultural perpetuity. And so I realized actually there's a lot of projects and a lot of people working in different spheres that it might be a nice way to spread out projects and a

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:16.000
way to, you know, put them on a table and kind of spread them out a little bit if we, if we were to spread out the ones that are focusing on individual growth or individual actualization versus ones that are focused on community organizations or groups

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.000
so that was one area and that became my that ended up kind of holding it holding weight over the long term and so that became my Y axis.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And then the next one was basically how there are some people are doing great divergent thinking and some people are doing great conversion thinking so another way to say that as some people really exploring into the field and other people are really

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000
making sense of it and applying new concepts in the real world. And so I spread that became my other and that became my x axis.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And then I realized that these pictures started to go together. And that was after the fact to sign it originally, and realized that if I spun the 2d picture of the, of the yin yang I that little path became an infinity symbol and I started realizing

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that I basically drawn the same things twice.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So it was nice confirmation from the field for me.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Then I decided, Okay, I don't think four boxes is enough, it might be nice if we could break it down even more and realized, I started gravitating towards the wheel of CO creation because I wanted this to be holistic I actually not really don't really

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:35.000
care about the framework, I think the framework the words that we use can change. What I wanted was a system that had been thought through that was holistic so that we could see the pieces that we were working on and the pieces that were missing.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And so I just gravitated towards that one but quite a few people are working with me on what I want the terminology could be and whether that's the right one or not.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
again, that can evolve to me over time.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And so then it comes into. Now what right how do we use this thing and that's the z axis, and there's multiple options for way we can do the z axis and these are some of the ones I'm playing with it you know and this is why the tech support is so necessary

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:20.000
because the all our problems and all the things we're trying to do and the projects are so complex and they exist really in three dimensional cube sometimes spirals of things that we can't see it, and I think that's what we're struggling with.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So again, having having the layers and having people, people being able to control the layers I think are super helpful. so again I'm trying to move on for time.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So, um, the last question really remaining is how do we allow people to put their own piece in to say this is, this is the segment that I belong in, and then allow the whole community to see everyone together in those segments.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And so basically there's what Vince and I had a nice conversation about it, saying, okay, so maybe what we do is we ask people a questionnaire, that's a little bit more like their profile, like, you know, the people are used to being asked their interests

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and stuff maybe there's a way we can guide people into placing their peace, instead of looking at the grid because that's super complicated. Let's let them walk through a series of questions.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And then they that places their peace, then they can see their peace in the hole if they want to, and see it through different layers, however they want to sort it or or layer it or filter it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And then if their pieces in the wrong place they get a chance to move it right so that part of the technology, I don't think is too much of a stretch from what we already have available to us, versus some of the other stuff I've been working on which

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:53.000
was much more of a stretch. So to me this starts to have a lot of juice and excitement around it because it's enough of a framework we can at least take a step forward or two, maybe three, but it's not so far ahead of where our technology is that it's,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:11.000
it's, it's going to be another year or two before we have anything, so I'm currently trying to work with. Infinity on this Trove seriously app us, and open future coalition there's there's conversation starting to happen, about how this could be used,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and I'm open to suggestions and I went two minutes over it's so

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:30.000
funny. That looks really cool. I. One thing that occurs to me is I think I love the puzzles and the pieces, and I think sometimes we're actually, it's a couple different puzzles with all the pieces mash together right so then you have to not only find

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.000
your place in a puzzle but you have to make sure your, or you have to decide whether or not you're in a puzzle or not.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Yeah, and I think that's, that's fair and I think that's why it would be interesting to have the different layers right so there could be a layer for, you know, the different puzzles right so she could go forever with the layers and then that will get

00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:05.000
complicated as well. So I think it's why it's important that people will be able to look at it in a way that works for them. And that's a big that that I think is the hardest part of this, of this idea is, is not placing people in it, but then once everyone's

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:16.000
in it. Being able to change it. You know it could be just going back to their profile changing and then looking at the whole again it doesn't necessarily have to be in the grid itself, although it'd be lovely if people could drag and drop into a different

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
spot.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:28.000
But you know just then being able to change it and then being able to see it in ways that are meaningful to them, whether they're the head of a group and they want to see the whole group, or they want to see how their piece interacts with other pieces

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:42.000
they want to zoom in on one one segment and see where, where the potential collaboration points are with other people are doing similar things, or whether they want to look at where the holes are and say oh, there's someone offering expertise or something

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:56.000
that no one's actually doing anything and I need to collaborate with that. I mean, it raises questions, I don't think we can even ask now. And I think that's the point of it is what questions will come from it not want answers right so to me and to have

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
it not be so chaotic that the questions are meaningless.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:13.000
So I got one quick question but I'm just I feel like I'm a bit of an outlier here on day population but if there's something we could start with like, here's two things I had one I would love to go through whatever you would propose is a questionnaire

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:32.000
to figure out, Okay, how do I relate to these things that might also uncover some, you know, word choices that are being used that people get confused with or, you know, and the second thing is, I could see myself being in two places at once.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Just because multiple pieces of work I'm doing that are only related because you know it's the same human doing to. Exactly. No, that's, that would be the point.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:52.000
You have interests that you could put in you could have expertise that you could put in, you have projects that you can put in and those could all be in multiple, you get to put yourself in as many spots as you want to.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And the way I see it too is almost fractal like somebody may just go Oh I like talking about economics whatever I'm done with this whole thing I'm not interested.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Right and put their one piece in and whatever. And then other people may go oh not only my interest in x five expertise in this area. I'm working on a project, these are other people are more like here are five suggestions are great resources here my

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Here are my leading questions here right and they're all their stuff could be in one segment, that's fine. Right, so, and then, so it's how it becomes more of a right the first step here is to figure out a framework that is even something slightly helpful

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and then the next one is how do we show it to people so that it's useful, and what I hear you saying bill too is like not only can it get complicated, but we want to allow people to drill down, so that if there's too much information they can they can,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:53.000
they can zoom in to me I want to say that it looks brilliant. And what I want to do is fill out a questionnaire right away because I want to so what can I just get started This is how I got involved with Vincent here.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Getting the catalyst. So, now I is brilliant and Wendy, I'm going to screen share because I don't know if you've done it justice, compared to, like, what we.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And so basically how this prototype worked was like basically there's these different squares with like Wendy said the sector is on the left, and then the, like, basically is.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:32.000
So, in economics, I have like an interest in talking about new economic systems but I'm not creating anything that's available for public use that's like in the world being applied.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I also have done some experiments with a failed business from A to Zed oh where I was applying, you know, things with economics within. And like experimenting in the real world with economics and then like for media right so like currently available for

00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:00.000
use like Trove, and I've made like a VR meditation app which is out on YouTube, within like the spirituality sector. And the really cool thing about this as you start to see the gaps.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:14.000
When he was saying is like you can like if everyone did this from a group, then you can be like wait a minute we have no one, applying any of this, or we're no one is doing any research and we're just like building too quickly or none of us are thinking

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:30.000
about justice or governance. And so it's interesting when you start overlaying the different maps on top of each other. Um, but yeah, this I think kind of answers a few questions about like yeah you can put yourself in multiple different squares in this

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
tapestry, which I love the name by the way Wendy.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Yeah, Jonathan San helped me come up with it we played around with that 20 different words before we were like tapestry and I was like thank god yes.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Yes, I'm happy to share, I actually created a Google Form yesterday, as it as like a mock up but it's, it really needs like Vincent's help or something right because of Google Form, it's just too long.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:05.000
It's too cumbersome you really want to be able to people to answer some initial questions and based on their initial answers, pop up other sections because, you know, and then it makes it feel.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I could tell already it would make it feel easy and, but if I were to lay it all out every option of every question, you're going to answer it's like you want it to be sequential like a, you know, type, type form.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Yeah, right.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Yeah. And

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
yeah like conditional right if you've said yes to this then we open up this question. Right.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000
But there's there's a there's a company that does these sort of like question at a time, things that you.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I think it's called type form or.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
That is ubiquitous.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I'll find it if that's not it. But, Yeah, that could be really good.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And then the question or two puts us in a space of asking where people coming from when they talk about themselves, not what grid Do we have and forcing them to figure out what the structure of our grid is and how, making them understand what the different

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:17.000
sectors are so I want to really bring people in from a perspective of, you know, what is it you want to share with this group, not, not, do you, what areas do you talk about economy governance like I want to get to that later.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:30.000
That should be like the third or fourth question, not the first one and in my opinion because that's not how people generally think, or talk about themselves, unless they know they have an expertise in an area so I think, trying to also guide people to

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:42.000
it so that feels more fun and easy to answer. Okay, and that there's a lot of Yes, instead of like, I don't know what I do, it's not really this it's not really that I don't want to do this, you know, so, you know, assuming you have something I can fill

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
out because I really want to try this, because I know I'll learn something about myself.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And it might be helpful.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Sure, I'll just share one heresy I came up with a lot document in years ago was, and I should have known it 20 years ago when I was interviewing for a job and somebody said what's your passion and you know what I had no idea how to answer the question

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:16.000
because in my head goes like this is like an irrelevant question to me, we're talking about doing this piece of work.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
You know, and I started, I feel the same way what's your superpower.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
You know, I haven't done like.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So, those things in the context of useful but I think what you're doing.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I mean, I just want to like, let's see what can happen. And I would encourage you just move as fast as you feel you can get something into the hands of us, so we can actually make it better.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Do not overthink this. Yeah.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Well good thank you for the encouragement. This has been already a sprint, I'm up until about two o'clock every morning. So, because I'm so excited about it, trying to put as much time as I can into it so your encouragement is helpful, especially two

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:12.000
o'clock in the morning after we do with there's people still going through this but they, you know, one of the things when I was building software jerks we did with our customers and we just put basically the a pale imitation of some kind of a system

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
into their lab.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Before the receiver and ready. And the thing that made them do is to figure out oh my god we're going to have a computer in here what, you know, where second ago. So we really moved fast.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Yeah, which means you know you get to choose the most important things and a lot of things fall aside that may not actually be that important to keep going anyway yeah okay so however think yourself really, I do it myself.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Yeah, so help me out, you would love to have a questionnaire to fill out that gives me the tapestry and the three dimensional chart I'm like, great. Well, I would like to figure out, can I answer this, honestly.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And where would that put me. Yeah, for you. Now, the spreadsheet that I gave to Vinson and you could fill it out.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to figure out how can I help you, this is how I think I could help you. Yeah, so let's do that, I'll share the spreadsheet. Right.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And I'll share a PDF of it because I don't, we can't really collaborate on it. I don't think that's right we put it on Google Drive with that get too messy if I put it on Google Drive and everybody, you should do with us for you.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:33.000
If it's a PDF I'm going to use preview and type into it because my handwriting is terrible. So, I'm, you know, I'm just going to end up editing the editing than typing stuff into the PDF and sending it back here.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Yeah, I would just hate for somebody to delete someone else's thing but maybe it's more fun to kind of see as it grows on, on a collaborative space.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Well, I was gonna say if you, if people fill out the form individually in the PDF, and then you're figuring out how you want to call it after the fact, at least you got the raw material and people aren't going to type over each other stuff, so it'd be

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:11.000
a way to move fast on the getting the input, and then you can look into how to, how to cook Colette it, and tabulate it.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And I would check out type form, because I think it might be a way to like take the input, allow people to just, you know, not really understand the whole form and how it's going to end up but just answer a sequence of questions that can be triggered

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:42.000
and divert you down to like sub levels of questions if you want, and then have all the stuff in one system that then you can then tabulate.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Yeah.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Yeah, I think. Yeah, sounds like type form has been what you're saying more flexibility and options then Google Form.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Yeah I think so i think so I haven't plumbed it. We've just used a little bit, but ok so here will be my plan I will try and I think a questionnaire is nicer than just handing people to chart, and it will get us closer to what we need.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:19.000
So I'm going to it for a week, I'm going to try and put together the questionnaire. And if that's not working like if I'm not liking the features and I think it's too complicated, then at least for these groups, I will, I will put out.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Just the Excel spreadsheet with some instructions, you know if if people want to fill it out the can turn I suggest in the in the building out of like quick and dirty, that maybe you give us, or at least me and Bill, I don't know who else is interested

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:49.000
in security gave it to Vince and, you know, give us that just so like you're, you're, you're seeing like what kind of input you're getting and what kind of length of question answers you're getting and I'll do the type form thing again.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:57.000
You know when you have it, but take advantage of our momentum in this meeting, at least among us few.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Yeah. Where can parallel agile Agile Software is how fast can you get something into the hands of the people that are going to use it. Yeah, but in a way that doesn't isn't annoying or like what is this Yeah, were you going to try it or how much work

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:23.000
does it work make for you but you know so so knowing we're going to end this call, put it in. Should I put into matter most then into the flotilla channel.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Okay. True, drop it in there that way. Everyone's got it and, yeah, I gotta jump anyway because

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
it's time to go here. Okay.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Thank you. That was fun for me. And I think Zeke for prompting me to put it into a presentation so thank you for that was very well done.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Yeah, well I was everyone have a good week, youtube.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Id around the internet, everyone.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Yeah, when he loved the presentation.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
And I was like, he doing on the framework.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
It was so much fun.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:17.000
It was when you got to the framework that I like IDM Wendy saying, will you share a copy of this because I want to go look closer than I can on the period and and then shared it, which I still want to do.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Yeah.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:28.000
I hope I can help because I feel like there's there's

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:37.000
what one of the challenges that I'm seeing too is like, it's, it's,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:49.000
it may be, you know, type for my help do this but in other ways and sort of presenting the concept. I think it's it's simpler and more essential than it looks.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And you know, how can we help you, you know distill it to like something that people will get and respond to, you know, easily and quickly.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Yeah. So, Yeah, yeah, that's why I think it's so nice to hear everyone's excitement because that's what I was thinking like, Oh, I think I finally found a way that simple enough, and yet provides enough framework at the same time to hold all the complexity

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:34.000
like How is that possible but this seems to be working so far so we'll just keep. I'm very much in that spot thank you for articulating that Michael because that's the key right if people find it easy to use, and yet it somehow becomes a repository for

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:49.000
the complexity of what we're all trying to deal with, we have this is, this is great, Right, so, and I'm sure and I'm hope it'll change over time and I hope that will morph it and it will grow right so I don't by any means think even if we get to something

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
where that we're excited about that it's done.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:03.000
I think this is going to be growing for a while if we're onto something. It should morph and change and get better over time as we use it. And that's even more exciting to me.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
So,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:14.000
yeah, thanks, everyone, I think, I think also that that thinking of the notion of of.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:37.000
This is like a not sexy sounding word but you know template ization of this kind of idea of extracting this kind of critical tabulated information from groups of people who are using different platforms, so that you know you can sort of see oh well, you

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:57.000
know, where you know week on economic expertise here and heavy on this kind of actual practice here. But on this other platform there's this this group of people who wait in a different way and how can we bring those people together, whether it's CTA

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:13.000
and flotilla or, you know, whatever, you know. Yeah, and I think the exciting part two is there's so many people who, who, who are in key spots, who see who are seeing for themselves some of, so I I'm hearing more and more in the last six months oh I

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:22.000
see how everyone's connected, I'm waiting for everyone else to figure it out yet why are we waiting for everyone else to figure it out like we got to have a place where the people who see it, put it.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:35.000
So, so that we, we can connect faster. So to your point, like maybe there's two organizations that could be collaborating beautifully together, and it takes them another year to figure out how they collaborate and and that's what I it's not that that's

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
bad that's great, but I just wants to happen faster.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
You know, and there and there are 433.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Right.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Vincent, I don't know if you did you share the Hollies presentation that you shared with me with Wendy.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Definitely Well, I'll share Yeah, and I think I shared it with you, Stacy and Zeke we've maybe yeah if you know sticking a link in the chat, I think it's really really helpful to think about how many entities, there are with the right mindset about this

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:28.000
stuff but all the things that keep them apart and and Ali bream McIntosh did this presentation, kind of an academic presentation about all the things that keep us from collaborating.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:42.000
And, you know, doesn't doesn't really have the solution but you know certainly talking about how we might address that, because it's not for lack of of desire.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Yeah.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
When I enter into those ends.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:25:06.000
You know the ideal expression I think or ideal ripple effect, maybe it's a better term, of, of a chart or grid or tapestry like this, is that, as a community, people can start looking at what is an essential component, a framework a platform tool an app

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:19.000
that needs to be developed more as a priority to enable all the other things that are happening, it'll be easier for people to see and agree together I think what needs to come first.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Right. And then I think there are other great tools out there like matrices and things like that to help people make decisions and we were, we were talking a little bit about that on.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Earlier this week, but I just, I right it's, it's, it helps each individual sense make, and it helps the community sense make whatever that means for that community.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Right. And so I think that at its best it's going to really start to bring things into focus either. Wow, we may all be working on different pieces but right now if we all combined efforts towards this one piece, it's going to enable everything we're

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:01.000
trying to do and right now that's very hard to see.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Can somebody put the chat in the matter most.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
I don't know how to do it or I would

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:18.000
do you know, Stacy that if you, if you click the three dots in the corner you'll save a copy of it, too.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
and I'll never find it,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
that it actually puts it in a titled folder.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
So, Search flotilla then you'll see your flotilla.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
I'll try that. Okay.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
It did.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:55.000
And Stacy I've also been working. I don't feel like I'm hundred percent happy with it yet, but I've been working on the light Trove event page like this week have made like some really big updates in preparation for a conference that's going to be on

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:12.000
platform. And so now like on the event page. I'm like kind of making it easier to like collaborate on this page for like the event repository so this is today's event and I put like, for example, this was like an image I took while Wendy was talking that

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
I wanted to like upload so it's like here attached to the context of this event.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:31.000
And then these are all the links that were shared in the, in the chat. And then I have also my like personal notes on the event here, but we could also then like add like collaborative notes.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:42.000
So this is something that yeah working on making it a lot easier to make this like a collaborative process as like a way to store the repository of all the information.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Thank you.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:28:00.000
So I put the link if you want to explore but the one thing that I haven't actually done is like right now, there's a lot of Trove events which have the, the zoom chats, but I'm curious, like, do you guys actually ever go back to the zoom chats and like

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:16.000
if so do you. Why, because I actually haven't made it so you can like see the chat I just kind of know that it's valuable to keep them but like yeah I'm curious, like, do we not go back to the chats because it's just like a text file, like, would we go

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:24.000
back to them if it was easier or like do we not go back to them for certain reasons.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:35.000
So, as the least tech savvy person here I go back to them to find the links that I want to look into further.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:46.000
So you're not clicking on things in the chat as the discussions happening, you use the. Okay. You use the repository to, to find those links later you trust that they'll be there.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Correct, yeah, yeah. Whereas I'm like frantically trying to click on stuff during the chat, like, and and and have those tabs open and then of course later forget where they came from and why have them open right yeah no I need to focus on what's happening

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:09.000
here to like get caught up and they need time separate to go slow.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:25.000
For me, I tend not to go back because it's like, you know, cleaning the grout in my shower, that's kind of, you know, it's like, it's something that it stares at me every day and I really want to do, but like never becomes a priority.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
That's the way it feels. And I think because it's just not fun. And it's a lot of sense making and even when I get this stuff I don't know where to put it.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:43.000
I don't have anything to put. I don't have anything to, I don't have and this is why i doing what I'm doing right like it's I don't have a place to sense make it so it's just another list of links.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:53.000
And so unless it really applies to something I'm doing right now it's hard for me to feel motivated around, going back to it.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
And then of course when it when those links, do apply to my life right now I forgotten that they were ever there, you know, and that's the,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:13.000
you know, I do save them with the intent to break them down into, into smaller kernels like, you know, and I wish they were searchable.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:40.000
You know I want to see, like, there are times when I want to say, I'd like to see all the stuff that, you know, all the links that Wendy posted in the last few flotillas and all the stuff that can Homer commented in the OGM during this period because

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
I remember there was some good stuff.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:50.000
You know, or specifically all the Jerry's brand links, you know, or whatever.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:31:09.000
And, and I wish there was that so I want to save the chat so I can feed them into that machine which is, you know, cat about Plus, you know, I guess, with like more attributions and then you know and then tag, I'd love for the group to be able to incrementally

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:22.000
add tags to things, you know, things were tagged only as they intrinsically are with timestamp and and personal attribution. And then the text were searchable.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Then you could go on to saying, like, you know, this comment was, regarding economics, you know this was regarding.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
And in the grid.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Yeah, yeah, we're going to into the tapestry. Yeah. Yeah. So I think if it were me, Vincent looking forward to what I think is coming. The fact that you've gotten to a point where you can scrape all the links and at least they're in one spot at is really

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:06.000
valuable if there's only a handful that's super easy right I could review them for myself and make sense of them, if there's a lot of them that it's almost like an extra service to have an archivist kind of person.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Put them, you know, put them tag them and, you know, and whether it's, you know, as part of the tapestry or just for that community or both right so that the community can make more sense of them going forward.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.000
I actually think that becomes incredibly valuable, especially if if it's, there's some sense making around it.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Yeah.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:42.000
And there yeah and there's definitely some like automated tagging but yeah I think it requires like some manual, you know gardening, it's always going to and so like these are the links from today's chat up to like a certain point, And so yeah like I've

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:52.000
been working on making it easier to like just click to edit and then like to add tags or to, you know, add your own title or description.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:01.000
And like some of them, you know like Twitter links don't work so you have to like manually kind of curate, some of them.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Or like, there are certain things where you might want to also like be like, oh this is like a zoom link or like this is something I sent to someone in like a private message and you want to make it private so there's also like there's, there's the necessity

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:27.000
of having an additional layer over just a bulk import, I think, so that's kind of I've been like taking on that role. And then, like, if I add anything into an event I've been deleting anything that shouldn't be there and like learning the patterns of

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:45.000
like okay like these are the things that people usually share and in the zoom chats right. Um, but yeah, the next step is like, if it's if it's just as easy or easier to add something not in the zoom chat like for example in the GM calls we were putting

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
links inside of the matter most for some for a time.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Right. So, there, there, there also are ways to use tools with alongside zoom instead of trying to like fit into zooms limitation so like, you know like, I mean, I would love yeah like to get to a point where I it's faster for me to like, add a link on

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:21.000
the event page, which I have like side by side of zoom and then be able to add the tags and hit submit, and even, like, share it with people like if someone's like, Oh, I really want this I can be okay let me tag you with it so it shows up in your home

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:29.000
for later. Right, so we are also helping each other, manage the complexity and not just like me me me me me.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:39.000
I'm Vincent I just noticed that, that sounds great, and I noticed looking at the form that you were showing there.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:48.000
I don't think I saw this but I wondered if there's a way okay like you know you go, you go, you know, we go to this flotilla.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
You know the event, this, this hotel or fall on Trove.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:12.000
And one of the links is something that we want to share with other people who aren't on Trove say tweeted out or god forbid posted on Facebook or you know whatever it is wherever we would want to put it.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Is there a way to share out from, from that event. And, and I suppose that gets to to also, you know, conventions have permissions to share different stuff that you know would have to pop up and say you're sharing something that isn't a private group,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
blah blah blah blah blah.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Anyway, I'm human hair, share a single link or like share all the links or like share the whole event page.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Oh, well, I meant specifically share a particular link, which obviously you can just copy the link and share it as you would otherwise but I was wondering if like, you know, sharing.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:19.000
I mean, thinking about like if something's all tagged up and described on Trove you're sharing more than a link, you're sharing like meta data that has been entered and, like if you shared that two factor or, you know, true.net or you know that those

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000
are the kinds of things that I can imagine we would want to

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:37.000
and and and also be able to have that link back you know see this on Trove versus just get the link and go, you know, somewhere else.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:52.000
I mean, talk about but now that's really interesting I haven't even thought about the leg by Wendy, the sharing component. Um, but like, this is, I was actually like kind of curious when you mentioned like I want to see all the brain links.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:05.000
So these are like the brain links that are intro, and on each one of these links. You could either copy the link to your clipboard and then, you know, just share it or you could open it in a new tab.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Or you can actually share it like on email or something, or Facebook remember, mom. And then, I think what you're saying is maybe you want to say like you know shared into like this event.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Intro with like the event link so you have like a backlink to like the context of where it came from. Right, right. Yeah, which is, which can be really cool.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Yeah, which is, I mean, you know, it's one of the, I think, appealing features of Twitter is like if something comes out of a conversation.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:57.000
It's good to see y'all again. Good to see you today, great weekend. Cheers.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
If you.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:07.000
You know, if somebody shared something in the context of the conversation there are lots of responses to it you know you're, you're, you're pulled back into that context.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
If you want to be.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Right. Yeah. Um, yeah I guess there's a whole there's a whole realm of the design of like engagement or interaction comments like yeah like the biggest part of Twitter's like being able to comment on other people's tweets and have the threads and so that

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:54.000
is definitely a, like a possibility an option for Trove I'm, I'm yeah I'm very hesitant to just read it without thinking about it too much. Like, without thinking about it right like some, some things about comments it's like it's a comment system just,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:07.000
you know, add comments, but then in the other than to the other way I like look at Facebook and like, there's just like incredible posts by Daniel Spock and burger and there's 195, comments, and I'm like, Am I gonna have to read through all these and

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:24.000
also I already looked through all them and now there's new ones and now I have to go through them again. And so, like, I've been wishing for like also to have like filters on comments right or like be able to put a comment type right like this is a an

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:39.000
argument that I want people to respond to or this is like, I want to just add a link here, or right there's different like types of comments you might want to add so that's something I've been thinking about is before incorporating comments like yeah

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:53.000
like maybe, what would it look like if we were to have a comment system that could handle that, like, the scale and complexity that comes with like millions of people being able to be in one room at once, which doesn't happen in the real world.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Yeah. Yeah. And also controls, I mean this is something that, you know, we've got on on factor, like, you know, being able to say, only people in this group can comment on this or.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
There are no comments on this or, you know, those kinds of things.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:34.000
so that you know you have the choice between letting some people observe a conversation going on among a limited number of people so it's sort of like you're attending a panel discussion, versus, you know, wide open, anybody, anywhere can say whatever

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:43.000
they want, and spam. Everyone or whatever. Yeah, yeah, likely

00:40:43.000 --> 00:41:03.000
to talk about.
