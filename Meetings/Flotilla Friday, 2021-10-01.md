# Flotilla Friday, 2021-10-01

## Topics

- _how_ to pick a time for more FFs
- ees dsq321, real quick
- updates about other communities
- debrief last week
- partition the problem of interoperability
- decentralization and web3
- hyperknowledge

## How to Pick More Times for FF

- geographic coverage
    - Pacific
    - Eastern
    - Europe (CET, BST)
    - Thailand
- friendly for people who have jobs
- some options
    - two meetings a week
    - alternating times every week
    - collaboratively chosen times, probably different, each week
- goals
    - have more than one time, because one time will never work for everybody
    - minimize noise and confusion around "what time is the meeting?"
    - minimize split-brain community

### Outcomes this meeting

- stick with current time until Daylight Savings time settles down
- do the actual time picking asynchronously
    - maybe a google sheets thing, or doodle or something

### Minimizing split-brain community

- be good about agendas beforehand
- be good about reporting out afterwards
- be good about recording meetings (automate?)
    - re: recording and processing meetings, Pete, Jerry, Bentley are thinking of making some code/service that helps do that
- make sure at least a few people can attend both meetings and cross-inform / cross-connect the meetings
